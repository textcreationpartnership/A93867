            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough Preſſes in the preſent age are much oppreſſed, and many fools will be medling, that they may be fools in Print; Yet we think this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> ſhould have much wrong, and ſo ſhould Chriſtian Infants, if it ſhould be concealed from publick veiw. For this we hope may muzzle their mouthes, who have long cryed out, <hi>give us a Precept for Infant-Baptiſme.</hi> If ſuch do not winke, here they may ſee it. And if their wits be not quicker to deviſe ſhifts, then their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to receive truth, here we conceive is ſatisfaction ſufficient.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Everards</hi> Paſquill (no nick-name for ſuch ſheets of Satyrical invectives) how can it but be nauſeous to all ſober minds? If a truth ſhould be ſo diſguiſed, it would look unlovely; how much more his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? Which error of his is ſo abundantly refuted by this ſober and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tract, which makes the way ſo clear for little Children to come to Chriſts Baptiſme, as they did to his armes, and bleſſing: that unleſſe their adverſaries bluſh to recant and repent, (as the Emperor <hi>Heraclius</hi> did, when the Hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> with which he was tainted, was condemned,) they will henceforth waſh thoſe children with teares, which they have craftily and cruelly kept from Baptiſmal waſhing.</p>
            <p>To returne to this Book, we apprehend that the ſubſtance and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative part of it doth ſincerely and ſoundly hold forth the truth: and that in the evidence or power of the ſpirit of truth. If there be now and then redundance of words, let it be looked upon as the Authors affection to make the matter clear to the meaneſt judgments.</p>
            <p>And glad we are that in this reply to <hi>Baby-Baptiſme routed,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author hath followed the Apoſtles rule, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. and not rendred rayling for rayling. We can be confident that as it ſavours much of the Spirit of God, ſo it will have the more influence upon the ſpirits of Gods people.</p>
            <p>Our own experience hath found this in our anſwering the challenge made us of diſputation in this point four years ſince by Mr. <hi>Knollis</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kiffin.</hi> Which challenge we received and anſwered (may we ſpeak
<pb facs="tcp:117779:4"/>it with modeſty) with moderation towards them from whom we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved provocation enough. And with what happie ſucceſſe, we can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably referre to thoſe thouſands who heard the diſpute, but chiefly to the happy ſtanding faſt of our own great people in this truth of Infant-Baptiſme. Though we confeſſe we daily fear the lot of other great pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that ſeducers will creep in amongſt us.</p>
            <p>We have ſometimes heard that our Antagoniſts at their returne gave thanks in their Congregations for the good ſucceſſe of their long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. But if deſervedly, as to the point diſputed, we wonder then, that we within a moneth ſending them a copie of the diſputations, written by their own ſcribe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Coppe,</hi> and withall the Preſſe all this while keeping open doores, they have not committed it to publick veiw and vote: nor ſent us their hands that we might do it, according to Articles before the diſpute.</p>
            <p>What wrong they have done us and the truth by clancular and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive narratives of the buſineſſe, as we have cauſe to fear, ſo we leave to their own boſomes to judge. <hi>Reader,</hi> let not this convenient digreſſion tire thy patience in the peruſall of this Reverend Authors work, whoſe worth, we already aſſure our ſelves, will with much clearneſſe appear to thee, as it does to us; and we doubt not will to thoſe of his oppoſites who (as <hi>Syneſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cyrene</hi> his expreſſion was) had not rather loſe their hearts then their conceits. Now, together with the book, we are thine in the truth as it is in Jeſus.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I come to the diſcourſe it ſelf, it ſhall not be unprofitable to ſhew the cauſe that firſt moved me to enterpriſe this buſineſſe, and the ſeverall ſteps by which I have been carried on. For the cauſe (alas is too manifest!) many people among us, and ſome of good hope, have been drawen aſide to follow the way of the ſeparation. Things ſtanding thus, I could not but as a private Chriſtian, by the band of love; but more eſpecially as a Miniſter of the word, by relation of office; I could not (I ſay) but riſe, and look after ſuch neighbours and friends of mine, who (in my aprehenſion at leaſt) were as ſheeep gone aſtray. Therefore about the end of <hi>January</hi> laſt, I took occaſion to go to <hi>Earles-Shilton,</hi> a neighbouring town in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> where the Maſters of Diviſion have played their principall game: My pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was by conference with them to know the reaſons of their departure from us. When a competent number of that way were gathered together, ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded errors in our Doctrine, others corruptions in our Ministery, and a third ſort faulted our Churches conſtitution. But in concluſion of that days diſcourſe, I found that the point which they did bind very much upon, was this; <hi>That there word was no word of command for the Baptiſme of Infants in the New Teſtament.</hi> I found that this principally moved them to renounce the old, and to take up a new Baptiſme; to leave the old, and to joyn themſelves to a new Church. Hereupon I told them, that however others look to the ancient uſe of the Church in the Baptiſme of Infants, I was perſwaded that there was a word of institution: and had I time more fully to ſtudy the point, I hoped I ſhould make it appear. They deſired me to take time; and our agreement was that before my next coming I ſhould give them a weeks warning: which I did accordingly, and appointed the <hi>27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> for the particular day of our conference. I deſired that ſome of their more ſolid and principal men would be there, for the tryal of truth: and this I ſignified by letter a week before. But when I came, I did not find the men I looked for. Whether they were abſent on ſet purpoſe, or whether there was a real cauſe of their abſence, I cannot tell. Therefore I did publickly, according to that light I had, Preach a Precept
<pb facs="tcp:117779:5"/>for the Baptiſme of Infants before the People: and when I had done, I did leave one brief Argument behind me in writing, for the freinds of the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conſider of. Since that time I acknowledge that I have received two anſwers, the one upon the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> and the other upon the fifth of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> And I could wiſh that the laſt Anſwerer (which was one Mr. <hi>Robert Everard</hi>) had not been ſo haſtie to put his Anſwer in Print: but rather that he and I had gone on in the way we were in, to try the matter by writing each to other. Sure I am, by this friendly and private way of enquiry, he and I might have gained very much, at leaſt the one might have come forth more ripe for the publick veiw. What his ſecret reaſons were, I know not; His way of life being itinerary from place to place, it is a queſtion whether ſuch a narrow and ſet diſquiſition of truth would not have fixed him too long to one place; Or whether (according to the title of his book) he did inwardly beleeve that he had given a totall rout to the Baptiſme of Infants: Or whether it were to eaſe his own ſhoulders of the burden, and to call in more of the party to his aſſiſtance. For my own part, I beleeve the matter being now brought into Print, I am not now to deal with this or that particular man, but with the whole nation of them that are againſt a Precept for the Baptiſme of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants: And this I take to be no ſmall number. For I beleeve the piety of former times (as they then called it) was not greater to ſet up high altars, then it is now to divide into new Churches. And therefore to a man who maketh it one of his cheif deſignes to ſet up a new Church, to erect a new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, and to cast all into a new mould, what better principle can he have to begin withall then a new Baptiſme? I do expect therefore when I go about to ſhew a Command for the Baptiſme of Infants, that I ſhall not want ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt me, both from principles of conſcience, and from principles of intereſt. However, I am reſolved, (being caſt upon it) to put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now (by the Lords aſſiſtance) unto publick triall. One member of the disjunctive muſt needs be true; either there is a Precept for the Baptiſme of Infants, or there is not. For my part I beleeve there is; and therefore I ſhall be the more willing to ſhew the grounds on which I build. If any one be of opinion that the world is too full of books in this kinde, and that little more can be ſaid then hath been already; I would intreat ſuch a one to look upon the doubts that are in the Conſciences of godly men every where, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the preſent neceſſities and diviſions of the Church: And I beleeve when he hath done ſo, he will have ſmall reaſon to complain of too much water, ſeeing all is on fire. For that ſpeech of the wiſe man, <hi>The thing that hath been, it is that which ſhall be, and there is no new thing under the Sunne,</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>1.8.</hi> I acknowledge that there is a truth in it, yet not as it is too ordinarily
<pb facs="tcp:117779:5"/>applyed. For I can avouch by experience (and I ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſſe) that in many hidden Propheſies, and in ſome ſubtill contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, when <hi>I</hi> have read all on both ſides, the truth hath not ſo clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto me as when <hi>I</hi> came to canvaſſe the Scriptures, to dive into the ſenſe of them by meditation, and to compare Scripture with Scripture. This hath ſome way happened in the preſent controverſie. It may be then that which hath been to mine own, may (by the bleſſing of God) be ſatisfactory to the conſcience of another man. <hi>Reader,</hi> thou haſt now the reaſons that moved me to this work. Thus deſiring the help of thy prayers, that the thing <hi>I</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in, may tend both to the clearing of the truth, and (as much as may be) in theſe times of diviſion to the preſerving of the peace of the Church.

            <head>A PRECEPT for the Baptiſme of Infants out of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat this matter may be the more clearly underſtood, I will firſt alledge thoſe particular places of Scripture from whence the Precept is proved. Secondly, I will vindicate the argument which I gave to prove a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, from the exceptions of the Brethren of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and eſpecially from the late Treatiſe of Maſter <hi>Everard.</hi> For the places of Scripture, there are three texts in the New Teſtament which (as farre as I apprehend) being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expounded and cleared, will prove a Precept.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. where our Saviour ſpeaketh to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> He would have them now go to al Nations, that were formerly outcaſts of the Covenant, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, <hi>Epbeſ.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 11, 17. He would have them go teach, diſciple, and covenant all Nations in the Faith; and when the Nations ſhall come to be diſcipled, taught, covenanted, and brought ſo farre to own the faith of Chriſt come in the fleſh, then the commiſſion is, <hi>baptize the diſcipled Nations:</hi> to wit the beleeving parents, and the children, ſo farre forth at leaſt as they live under that education and tuition. Now contrarily, whereas many late Writers will have a Diſciple able to make actuall profeſſion in his own perſon, the only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Baptiſme; They are (to my underſtanding) greatly deceived in this point. For if the words of the text be literally, truly, and grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally read, not Nations onely, nor Diſciples onely, but diſcipled Nations are the ſubject of Baptiſme. When our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> who are they that he doth mean by the word <hi>(them)?</hi> doth he not mean the Nations, the beleeving Nations, the parents and their children? If it had been his minde that his Apoſtles ſhould baptize ſuch onely as did actually beleeve and profeſſe in their own perſons, and none
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117779:8"/>of their children, what could have been more eaſily ſaid then this, <hi>Go make Diſciples out of all Nations, and ſuch perſons that ye have made Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples baptize them onely?</hi> If this had been his meaning, he could eaſily have expreſt himſelf, that perſons ſo and ſo qualified are the onely ſubjects of Baptiſme. But ſeeing he ſaith <hi>Go teach all Nations baptizing them,</hi> he doth look here to a progeny and to a poſterity of beleevers; he doth here look to the Nations ſo farre forth as they conſiſt of beleeving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and children under their education. Seeing in the affirmative a diſcipled Nation is the ſubject of Baptiſme, in the negative a Nation not diſcipled is excluded from Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Now if any man ſhall ſay, where have you in the New Teſtament a Precept for the baptiſm of infants? I will ſay, In the words of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. If he ſhall reply, that there is no mention made of children in that text; My anſwer is, though they be not expreſſed in ſo many letters and ſyllables, yet they are contained in the word <hi>(them).</hi> When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith <hi>Teach all nations baptizing them,</hi> his meaning is to baptize them parents that profeſſe, in their own perſons, and their children ſo farre forth as they live under their Chriſtian education. Both together make a diſcipled Nation; and both joyntly are the ſubject of Baptiſme by the word of the Commiſſion. But that the children are contained in the word <hi>(them), Go teach all Nations baptizing them,</hi> I prove thus;
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, laying down the moſt remarkable circumſtances of the commiſion.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, by compating it with other places of the New Teſtament that have a near relation to it.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, by ſhowing the abſurdities that will follow in caſe the infants are not included where the Nation doth profeſſe.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the circumſtances, there are three remarkable and ſpeciall ones that ſhow the children to be contained in the word of Inſtitution.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, when our Saviour ſaith <hi>Go teach all Nations,</hi> there all Nations are ſet in immediate oppoſition to one Nation; all Nations in Covenant to the particular Nation of the Jewes in Covenant. And therefore as the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Nation of the Jews had the Covenant and the Seale, to admit them and their Infants into the Church, in the time of their own diſpenſation: So it is the minde of Chriſt in that ſence of the Commiſſion, that when the Nations receive the faith, they ſhould have the Covenant and the Seale for themſelves and their children in the time of the new diſpenſation. If this be ſo, that the oppoſition is between Nation and Nation, all Nations and that particular Nation, we may build upon it that in theſe words <hi>go teach all Nations Baptizing them,</hi> the children are compriſed in the word <hi>Nations,</hi> but more particularly in the word
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117779:8"/>
                  <hi>them;</hi> and are in the ſence of the Commiſſion, together with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the proper ſubjects of Baptiſme. If this be not ſo, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the oppoſition betwixt all Nations in Covenant and that one Nation?</item>
               <item>Secondly, by the time when the Commiſſion was given. It was at that inſtant when circumciſion ceaſed to be the Seale of admiſſion into the Jewiſh Church, after it had ſtood for two thouſand yeers together; At that very inſtant the Lord did appoint Baptiſme as an initial Seal to come in the place of Circumciſion; to performe the ſame office in the Churches of the Gentiles as Circumciſion did before in the particular Church of the Jewes. So then, if Circumciſion (as all do know) was the door to let in Father and Child into the Jewiſh Church, in all the time of that adminiſtration, we can judge no other but that it was the minde of Chriſt in his Commiſſion, that his Apoſtles ſhould teach all Nations: and ſuch of them as ſhould receive the faith, they ſhould by Baptiſme be let into the Church, beleeving Parents and their Children, after that manner as they were admitted in all the time of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration going before.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, when our Saviour gave Commiſſion to his Diſciples, <hi>Go teach all Nations,</hi> the doctrine that he would have them teach, was no other but the doctrine of the Goſpel delivered unto <hi>Abraham</hi> in the nature of a Covenant. <hi>The Scripture fore-ſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith, preached before the Goſpel to</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſaying, in thy ſeed ſhall all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gal. 3.8. being compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the minde of Chriſt, that through the Apoſtles preaching, the bleſſing of the particular families of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be conveighed to all the beleeving families of the earth; what can be more rational to conceive according to the Commiſſion, but that the Promiſe and the Seale are to be applyed to the beleeving families of the earth, to Father and Child, as it was formerly to the particular family of <hi>Abraham?</hi> The bleſſing muſt needs go from family to family, from the particular family of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the times of Circumciſion, to all the beleeving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth in the times of Baptiſme.</item>
            </list>
            <p>So then, the chief circumſtances of the Commiſſion being laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Firſt, all Nations in Covenant, ſtanding in immediate oppoſition to one Nation of the Jewes. Secondly, the circumſtance of time, that Baptiſme did preciſely begin at that inſtant, to be the Seale of admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Church gathered out of all Nations when Circumciſion ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thirdly, the ſubſtance of the doctrine, by preaching the Goſpel the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117779:9"/>Apoſtles were to bring the bleſſing of the particular family of <hi>Abraham</hi> into all the beleeving families of the earth. All theſe circumſtances laid together plainly prove, that Baptiſme is to be applyed to the Church gathered out of all Nations after the ſame manner (reſpecting beleeving parents and their children) as Circumciſion was applyed to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nation of the Jewes. And therefore when our Saviour ſaith <hi>Go teach all Nations baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> we can conceive no other from the circumſtances of the Commiſſion, but that by poſitive right, and by the appointed will, the children in a beleeving Nation together with their parents are comprehended in the word <hi>(Them)</hi> as the true and proper ſubject of Baptiſme. So then we have a word of command cleared from the Commiſſion, from the ſcope of the text, and the principal cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances do agree. Let us now go to parallel-Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if we compare parallel Scriptures in the New Teſtament, we ſhall finde, by comparing Scripture with Scripture, that the children muſt needs be compriſed in the word of the Commiſſion. For the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Scriptures, becauſe they are ſo largely handled by the late Writers, Mr. <hi>Cotion,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marſhal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and (as I hear) by ſome others late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come forth, I ſhall ſpare my paines, and referre the judicious Reader to their learned Treatiſes. Only to the purpoſe in hand, I deſire to lay down this as a ſure rule, that from whatſoever text in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Baptiſme of Infants may be proved, whether it be proved di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, mediately or immediately, ſeverally by one place, or joyntly by comparing many places together, which was ſoever it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the matter will come to this, that if the children have a right, they muſt be contained in the general command. And therefore when our Saviour ſaith <hi>teach all Nations baptizing them,</hi> we muſt needs ſuppoſe, that he ſpeaketh comprehenſively, that in the word <hi>(them)</hi> he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude every perſon that hath a right to the Seale under the new diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore if in any of the aforenamed Authors any one text will hold good for the Baptiſme of Infants, we may argue that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are contained in the head precept. Let us come to give two or three inſtances. The Apoſtle in that famous place ſpeaking of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of beleevers, doth uſe theſe words, <hi>The unbeleeving husband is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the wife, and the unbeleeving wife is ſanctified by the husband: elſe were your children uncleane, but now are they holy.</hi> 1 Cor 7.14. Here the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the natural children of beleevers that they are <hi>holy?</hi> I demand then, in what ſence doth he ſay they are <hi>holy?</hi> It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon on all ſides that it is not meant of inward holineſſe, becauſe the children are ſaid to be holy as being propagated from beleeving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117779:9"/>Therefore it muſt be one of theſe two wayes, either by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant holineſſe, (as we affirm,) or by legitimation of iſſue, as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Separation. But I ſay, the text cannot poſſibly be underſtood in the latter ſence; for then why may not the children of Turks and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars be ſaid to be holy, ſeeing many of them are borne in lawfull wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock? Secondly, if any text of Scripture may be found out where the children may be ſaid to be holy, becauſe lawfully borne, yet how can ſuch a ſence agree to the preſent text? Here only is mention made of beleeving and unbeleeving parents, of a clean or unclean iſſue as the parent is either beleeving or unbeleeving. Upon theſe conſiderations when the Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>the children are holy,</hi> this muſt needs be meant of federal and covenant holineſſe. He ſpeaketh of the time <hi>[Now] are the children holy</hi> to wit, in the laſt exhibition of the promiſe. And therefore, in the ſence of the Commiſſion, when our Saviour ſaith, <hi>teach all Nations baptizing them,</hi> his command was to baptize the Corinthians children, ſo farre forth as the parents did beleeve through grace. In this ſence, becauſe the parents did beleeve, the progeny was holy, as a part of a diſcipled Nation; and, according to the meaning of the Commiſſion, a lawfull ſubject of Baptiſme. The Corinthians children being fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally holy, muſt needs be contained in the word <hi>them, teach all Nations baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, from the maine ſcope of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. it is plaine that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles have now the ſame graffing into the Olive tree that the Jewes had before; and that the preſent graffing in of the Gentile is anſwerable to the caſting out of the Jew. So then if when the Jew was graffed in, he was graffed in and his children, it will follow, the Gentile being ingraffed in his place, he muſt needs be graffed in and his children. Again when the Jew was caſt out, he was caſt out and his children; and therefore when the Gentile was received in his roome, be muſt be received and his children. If this be not ſo, where will be the analogie between the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off of one linage and the implantation of another? the breaking off of ſome branches, and the ingraffing in of others? If the beleeving Gentile did not come in with his children in the place of the Jew caſt out, what ſhall we make of the whole ſence of the chapter? what ſhall become of the oppoſition between Nation and Nation? To whom may the Apoſtle be ſaid to direct his ſpeech when he ſpeaketh <hi>(Thou) art cut out of the Olive tree wild by nature, Thou beareſt not the root, but the root (thee). He that ſpared not the naturall brunches, take heed that he ſpare not [thee.] Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſeverity of God, but on (thee) goodneſſe.</hi> ver 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24. Now who is this <hi>(thou)</hi> and <hi>(thee)</hi> to whom he doth ſo frequently
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117779:10"/>ſpeak? It can be no other but the beleeving Gentile and his children, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Jew, caſt out of covenant and his children. If you apply this to the Commiſſion <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> what can be more naturall to affirme then that the children with their beleeving parents make up a diſcipled nation? and that both together are the lawfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of baptiſme? In <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. the beleeving parents with their children are contained in the words <hi>(them)</hi> and <hi>(thee),</hi> and they are alſo compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the word <hi>(them)</hi> in the commiſſion: <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing (them,)</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I might bring more places to prove that the children together with their parents doe make a beleeving nation. And for ſuch alſo that ſhall ſay that the children cannot be members in the Goſpel Church-ſtate, I might alledg the enſample of the Jewes at their call in the laſt times. For according to the prophecies it is cleare as they have been caſt out and their children, ſo at their call they ſhall be received and their children in a glorious manner. But theſe few inſtances may ſerve to parallel the Commiſſion, and to ſhew that the children are maintained in the word <hi>(them), teach all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> Now I come to inſtance the abſurdities in caſe the Children be excluded.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If beleevers children be not contained in the word <hi>(them) teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> theſe abſurdities will enſue. Firſt, whereas in the two former diſpenſations father and child entered into the Church together, in this laſt, beſt, and moſt large edition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the parents ſhall be taken in and the children ſhut ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, If the children be not contained in the word <hi>(them), teach all Nations bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them,</hi> there will be a change in the extent of the Covenant as to the particular of infants, and in reſpect of the ſubject the Lord Chriſt will varie from the uſuall way of adminiſtring the ſeal, and yet give no warning of ſo great a change. Thirdly, If the Children be not contained in the word <hi>(them) teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> what difference will there be between the children of ſuch that profeſſe the Chriſt come in the fleſh, and the Chriſtians of Turks his abſolute enemies? For if we take it as granted, that the children in the laſt diſpenſation have no right to Church priviledges, nor to the ſeale, let any ſhew the difference between the children of beleevers, and the Children of out-caſts of the Covenant, If they differ not in inward graces, nor in outward Priveledges, in what then do they differ? Fourthly, If the children be not contained in the word <hi>(them); teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> what ſhall we ſay in ſpeciall by thoſe of the Jewiſh Nation that were brought to the faith by the preaching of the Apoſtles? will it not neceſſarily follow, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117779:10"/>ſuch as did beleeve and receive the <hi>Chriſt</hi> come in the fleſh, by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving the promiſe in the laſt exhibition bring loſſe to their Children? Will it not neceſſarily follow, that the Children formerly Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſhall come to be ſpoyled of Church memberſhip; the Children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Sealed, ſhall come to be deveſted of the Seal; the Children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the Covenant, ſhall come to be expunged out of the Covenant? And all theſe dammages will follow upon the Jew his beleeving the <hi>Christ</hi> come in the fleſh. Fifthly, If the Children be not contained in the word <hi>(them,) teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> what will become of the comfort of Beleevers in this laſt diſpenſation? There is no true Beleever in theſe times, but he doth look upon his Children as borne in Originall ſin: where is then His comfort? His comfort is in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. But what if the Children muſt not be baptized? What if they have no right to the Seal of the Covenant? Can he preſume that they have a right to the Covenant it ſelf, and to Salvation by vertue of the Covenant? Where there is no title to the Seal (eſpecially in ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation where a Seal is annexed to the Covenant) what title is there to the Covenant it ſelf? Sixthly, If the Children be not contained in the word <hi>(them) teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> there will be a change in the heart of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> by his laſt words he will exclude them from the Seal and Church-memberſhip, of whom he ſaid in his former exhortations, <hi>Suffer little Children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 19.14. Theſe and many other abſurdities may be alledged in caſe Infants be excluded from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme.</p>
            <p>Now then, if this be ſo; what will become of thoſe ordinary ſpeeches of the adverſe partie? We want a precept, we have no word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To them I may reply that they make their caſe worſe then it is; they have a word of inſtitution to baptize Parents and Children. When our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> the Children living under the Chriſtian education are incluſively contained in the word <hi>(Them).</hi> We have proved this: Firſt, from the remarkable circumſtances of the Text: Secondly by comparing the Commiſſion with other Scriptures: Thirdly by ſhewing the abſurdities in caſe the Children are not contained collectively with their Parents in the Word <hi>(Them,) Teach all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> Now I proceed to anſwer ſome Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If they ſay that the Word <hi>(ethne)</hi> Nations, being a newter, cannot be ſubſtantive to <hi>(autous) Them,</hi> a word of the Maſculine gender.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:117779:11"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> They that ſhall ſo reaſon, let them peruſe the Originall in the Old and New Teſtament, and they ſhall every where find this <hi>Enallage,</hi> or change of Gender. To let paſſe all that might be brought, let them conſider that one Scripture concerning the looſing of Satan to ſeduce the Nations: <hi>And he ſhall go forth to deceive,</hi> (ethne) <hi>the Nations, that are in the four quarters of the Earth,</hi> God <hi>and</hi> Magog, <hi>to gather</hi> (autous) <hi>them together to battell. And they went up in the bredth of the Earth, and compaſſed the Camp of the Saints, and the beloved City, and fire came down from God out of Heaven, and devoured</hi> (autous) <hi>them. And the Devill that deceived</hi> (autous) <hi>them, was caſt into the lake of fire,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20: <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.9, 10. Now here it is plain that the word <hi>(autous) them,</hi> is three times together ſet in relation to the word <hi>(ethne) nations.</hi> From whence I gather in the ſence of the Commiſſion that the word <hi>(autous) them,</hi> muſt by the like reaſon neceſſarily anſwer to the word <hi>(ethne) nations:</hi> and this is the naturall conſtruction of the words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Secondly, If they ſhall object that then the Nations as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be the lawfull ſubject of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Not ſo neither. It will neceſſarily follow, that the Nations as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, as taught, as beleeving, as profeſſing Nations, in this ſence will be the proper ſubjects of Baptiſme. All Nations as Nations ſince the breaking down of the partition wall, have a generall intereſt in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel; <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.6. but this generall intereſt doth not intitle to Baptiſme. All Nations have a right to the Goſpel preached as Nations, but they have a right only to Baptiſme, Parents and Children, ſo farre forth as they are under diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling and teaching, and do yeeld to diſcipling and teaching.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Thirdly, if they alledge that the Commiſſion is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Jeſus made and baptized more Diſciples:</hi> therefore a Diſciple actually made, is the only ſubject of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> That ſuch a one is the lawfull ſubject of Baptiſme, I do willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; but that he is the only ſubject of Baptiſme, to the excluding of Infants under the Chriſtian education, this I deny. And I know no reaſon why we ſhould tye up the ſence of the Commiſſion (a law to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in all ages) to that particular inſtance of our Saviours making and baptizing Diſciples in thoſe firſt times. Give me leave to proceed in the like manner, and ſee whether by the rigor of ſome examples (in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at leaſt) I may not be able to break the force of any generall rule. Therefore let us take it as a granted maxime, <hi>that a Diſciple outwardly profeſſing, that every ſuch a one is the lawfull ſubject of Baptiſme.</hi> In ſuch a caſe as this is, what if a man would be peeviſh againſt Diſciple-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117779:11"/>might he not find out many colourable ſhowes? What if he ſhould ſay that ſuch as are able to ſpeak with divers languages, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gift of the Holy Ghoſt, ſuch only ought to be baptized? Will he not have a fair plea from the example of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? They were not baptized till the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44, 45, 46, 47. Again, what if he ſhould ſay, that a Miniſter at the entrance of his function, that he is the only ſubject of Baptiſme? Was not our Saviour baptized at 30 years of age, at the beginning of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery? Further, what if he ſhould affirme, that they that have taſted of the ſpirit of bondage, ought only to be baptized? Did not <hi>Ananias</hi> baptize <hi>Paul</hi> after great horrors? And were not the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple baptized by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan</hi> confeſſing their ſinnes? Laſt of all, what if he ſhould ſtand upon it, that only a beleever of the heart can be baptized? How plauſibly may he reaſon from the ſpeech of <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch? <hi>What doth hinder me to be Baptized? If thou beleeveſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt. Act.</hi> 8.36, 37. So then if you take 500 Diſciples of the Doctrine in ordinary experience, you will ſcarce find 50 that have a true faith in the heart. By the ſtrictneſs of this Rule not only Infants, but the greater part of Diſciples that make outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, muſt needs be excluded from Baptiſme. For of the greater part that make outward profeſſion, who can rationally or probably, or in the judgment of Charity (at leaſt by their fruits) conceive that the greater part have a true faith wrought in the heart. And thus you ſee how Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple baptiſme, (which the Separation themſelves allow,) is torne down by the preciſeneſſe and rigour of particular examples.</p>
            <p>I ſay then, that there lyeth a truth in all the forenamed examples; there lyeth a particular truth, that men ſo and ſo qualified, were the lawfull ſubjects of Baptiſme: but it doth not prove them to be the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate and full ſubjects of Baptiſme. He that doth beleeve in the heart, with a true faith, may lawfully be baptized; but we muſt not ſay, that a true juſtifying faith is neceſſarily required to the adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. So in the preſent caſe, when our Saviour firſt made, and then baptized Diſciples in the firſt plantation of the faith, there is no doubt but he did lawfully baptize ſuch as made actuall profeſſion. But the Queſtion is in the ſeverall ſucceſſions of the Church; when Religion is once planted, whether ſuch actuall profeſſion is neceſſarily required in all them that are baptized? In this caſe I ſay, the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors having the whole of the Nations to bring to the faith, they muſt needs carry on the work by degrees, by the joynt acts of teaching and baptizing. In this ſence, <hi>teaching</hi> muſt needs go before <hi>baptizing</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:117779:12"/>when the Goſpel is to be planted; and <hi>baptizing</hi> before <hi>teaching</hi> after the firſt plantation; And ſo both acts <hi>teach baptizing,</hi> and <hi>baptize teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> are to continue together in fluxe and ſucceſſion in all Chriſtian Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the end of the World. Therefore when our Saviour gave forth the Commiſſion, <hi>teach all Nations, baptizing them;</hi> we are not to think that he did look only to the time being, but to the continuation of a Chriſtian progenie and poſterity upon the Earth. If this be ſo, a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Nation is the lawfull ſubject of Baptiſme; and the beleeving Father (in the ſence of the Commiſſion) is to be baptized with his Child.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing they that diſſent from us are ſo willing to expound the Commiſſion by parallel Scriptures, I am content to apply my ſelf to that method. And therefore when the Prophets all along ſpeak of the call of the Gentiles, and of the bringing in of the body of the Nations; I would know the time when theſe Prophecies did begin to be fulfilled: They that diſſent from us muſt needs ſay, at that time when our Saviour bid his Diſciples <hi>go teach all Nations, baptizing them;</hi> they muſt needs ſay at that particular time he did begin to put the forementioned Promiſes and Prophecies in execution. If this be ſo, we cannot imagine when he ſaid <hi>teach all Nations baptizing them,</hi> that his meaning was to gather a few Diſciples out of all Nations by <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>baptizing.</hi> This might have been done in two or three of a Nation, only without the bringing in of the body of the Nations. But the words of the Commiſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a Promiſe a ſwell as a Precept: for our Saviour doth promiſe that the body of the Nations, firſt or laſt, ſhould be brought to the faith, and this we find more particularly declared in the whole book of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and verified in our own experience.</p>
            <p>From all that hath been ſaid we gather that not only all Diſciples, ſo made by actuall Teaching, but all Nations, ſo far forth as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Diſcipling and Teaching, and ſo far forth as they ſubmit themſelves to be diſcipled and taught, they and their Children living under the Chriſtian education, are a Diſcipled Nation, and in the ſence of the Commiſſion the lawfull ſubject of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Fourthly, If it be demanded what certain rule can be given to know a Diſcipled Nation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> There is nothing more eaſie to know then the publike profeſſion of a Nation. We may eaſily diſcerne how far forth they do acknowledge the <hi>Chriſt</hi> come in the fleſh, how far forth they look to have remiſſion of ſinne by his blood, how far forth they are willing to have their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren brought up in the Faith. Theſe things are in the publike veiw of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117779:12"/>men, and therefore as of old in one Nation of the Jews, when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were made proſelites by teaching, there was a command in that diſpenſation to circumciſe Father and Child as members of a diſcipled Nation. So in the Church gathered out of all Nations, as the Parents do now receive the Faith, and do enter into Covenant to profeſſe the <hi>Christ</hi> come in the fleſh, ſo far they and theirs muſt go under the account of a diſcipled Nation. And for the evidence of this to the adminiſtrator of Baptiſme, they may be known to be ſuch by the badg of their outward profeſſion.</p>
            <p>But yet nevertheleſſe for a more clear underſtanding of things and the taking away of doubts that may ariſe, let us diſtinguiſh between a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under <hi>Paganiſme,</hi> and a Nation where Chriſtian Religion is ſet up in the throne. If you ſpeak of a Nation under <hi>Paganiſme,</hi> we may ſay that ſuch a Nation is ſo far diſcipled, as any part of it doth ſubmit to the Faith. As for example, when <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> to preach the Goſpel, by his preaching he did not make the whole people of <hi>Rome</hi> a diſcipled people. But they were ſo far forth made a diſcipled Nation as any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men in that City did beleeve, and did engage themſelves to bring up all under their education in the faith of the <hi>Chriſt</hi> come in the fleſh: ſo far they became a diſcipled Nation, and no further. And this is the reaſon wherefore in thoſe firſt times we read only of the Baptiſme of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers and their houſholds, becauſe then the Chriſtian education was only in the houſes of the Faithfull; the Roman Emperour being as yet but a ſtep-father and an enemy to the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you conſider a Nation ſo far forth as the Chriſtian Faith is ſet up as the Religion of the State, in this ſence we take a diſcipled Nation in a larger extent. For not only the families of thoſe that truly beleeve, but the families of others alſo that are willing to yeeld to the Chriſtian education, and to live under the tuition of a godly Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Common-wealth, and the inſtruction of a powerfull Miniſtery in the Church; ſo far forth as they are willing to be guided by the Lawes and the Government of the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and are no worſe, ſo far they muſt go under the notion of a diſcipled Nation: and Parents and Children both be the lawfull ſubject of Baptiſme. If this be not ſo, let any man ſhew a reaſon why God ſhould tye his grace only to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe that truly beleeve, when the Children of others alſo are willing to live under the ſhadow of his Ordinances; and therein to wait for the in-coming and influence of his grace. In <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, not only they that were borne in his houſe, but they that were bought with his money, were eſteemed to belong to that education, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12, 17.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117779:13"/>If any ſhall ſay, that this was the time of the Jewiſh Church ſtate to take in all under that Government. He that doth ſo reaſon, let him ſhew the meaning of the Spirit in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> when he ſpeaketh of the reign of Chriſt upon the Earth, <hi>ch.</hi> 20. and of the Kingdoms of this world, that they became the Kingdoms of our <hi>Lord</hi> and of his <hi>Chriſt, ch.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 15.17. What is the meaning of this, but that the Kingdoms of this world being before the Kingdomes of the Beaſt, and yeelding ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his univerſall Headſhip, they became the Kingdomes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to live in ſubjection under the Goſpel as the Regent Law. By all that hath been ſpoken, a diſcipled Nation may be known by their ſubjection to the Goſpel, at leaſt by their outward profeſſion of the Faith to which they do ſubmit.</p>
            <p>I have ſtayed the longer upon this point by reaſon of a Queſtion that was put to me when I was at <hi>Earle-ſhilton.</hi> For being there, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting upon the Baptiſme of Beleevers and their Children, and that from the words of <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. a Queſtion was then put to me in theſe words; <hi>By what right do you baptize the Children in your Pariſh, do you take all your Pariſhioners for true Beleevers?</hi> My Anſwer then was, and now is; That I do baptize them as branches of a diſcipled Nation. For ſeeing the Parents do outwardly profeſſe the <hi>Chriſt</hi> come in the fleſh, and becauſe they are willing that I ſhould teach their Children the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Faith, upon this conſideration I do baptize the Children aforeſaid. So far as I underſtand I have a word of command for it: The Children being contained in the word <hi>(them,) teach all Nations bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whereas ſome godly People in theſe times impute the evils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us to Infant-baptiſme, in this they are deceived; it is for want of a Diſcipline to hold us unto that which we do profeſſe. Let any man take away a Coercive-government out of a Common-wealth, a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline from an Army, a Rod out of a Schoole; and then let him ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may not count as many diſorders in thoſe wayes, as now he doth ſee in Pariſh-Churches.</p>
            <p>To ſay the truth, we have had never an Excommunication, at leaſt none rightly uſed, and this hath been a great cauſe of the evill in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall-Church-way, in which now we ſtand. Therefore if things be out of order among us, (as indeed they are,) I do willingly confeſſe that this doth ariſe from the want of a Diſcipline, to make a ſeparation between the Precious and the Vile: It doth ariſe from want of diligent Catechiſing of Children according to the ſtrict truſts of their Baptiſme when they were firſt admitted: It doth ariſe from the want of a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117779:13"/>and ſpirituall Miniſtery, as formerly in greater meaſure, ſo now alſo in too too many places. It doth ariſe alſo from the want of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints to carry on the work of grace in one anothers heart,</p>
            <p>Theſe are the cauſes of diſorder, by which all the reſt is put out of frame. They then that impute theſe miſchiefes to Infant-baptiſme, they do impoſe upon us with a Sophiſme, they put that for the cauſe which is not the cauſe. That this may appeear, let us take it as granted; <hi>That a Diſciple able to make outward profeſſion in his own Perſon, is the only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Baptiſme.</hi> I ſay then <hi>by their own rule, the Maſters of Diviſion</hi> cannot deny Baptiſme to a Child of eight or ten years old, when he is able to repeat the principles of the Faith. If they deny it to ſuch a one, they muſt deny Baptiſme to a Diſciple; and what is this but to croſſe their own-principles? Again, if they admit ſuch a one to outward Baptiſme, (as admit him they muſt,) what true difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch a one and an Infant of three dayes old, eſpecially ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant whoſe Parents will faithfully promiſe and ingage for his education? For my part I am not acute enough to ſee a difference, at leaſt ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that men ſhould demoliſh Pariſhes, overturne Foundations, tear Churches and Congregations in peices, diſturb the peace of the Church and the Common-wealth, and ſet all on fire (as I apprehend) for bables and trifles. I have done with the firſt place, I come now to the moſt ſpeciall Scripture to prove the Baptiſme of Infants from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to Beleevers and their Children.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Scripture to prove a precept, is from the words of <hi>Peter</hi> in the firſt ſolemne adminiſtration of Baptiſme, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. Now that this may be more fully underſtood, I will take the liberty to open the Text in a plain and familiar way, by queſtion and anſwer. And therefore to begin with the firſt queſtion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, who are the <hi>Perſons to be baptized,</hi> when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>be baptized everyone of you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Perſons to be baptized are Beleevers and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>Queſtion <hi>How prove you that Beleevers Children are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beleevers Children are to be baptized, becauſe the promiſe is <hi>to you and your children,</hi> theſe words immediately follow the word of Command, and are added as a reaſon of the Command.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How will that appear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It will appear in the coherence of the Apoſtles ſpeech, and particularly in the word <hi>(For),</hi> which doth joyn the parts of the Text
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117779:14"/>together. He exhorteth them, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> and giveth this reaſon, <hi>For the promiſe is to you and your children.</hi> Therefore the promiſe is here repeated as the ground of the command.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. So you plead indeed for the Baptiſme of children by the word of command: but how do you prove the word of command?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I prove it thus, ſeeing there is ſuch a near relation between the word of promiſe and the word of command in the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, we may ſafely conclude, that if the children of Beleevers have a right to be Baptized by the word of promiſe, in the laſt exhibition, they have a right to Baptiſme by the word of Command. If they have a right to be baptized by the one part, they muſt have a right to Baptiſme by the Counterpane, or the other part of the word of inſtitution. In this matter we build the word of command upon the word of promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Yea, but the great doubt lyeth in this, what the Apoſtle meaneth, when he ſaith, <hi>for the promiſe is to you and your children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no queſtion to be made but he meaneth the grand promiſe of Chriſt, as may appear by his words in the chapter following, <hi>ye are the children of the Prophets and of the Covenant, which God made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſaying, in thy ſeed ſhall all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt hath God raiſed up his Son Jeſus, and hath ſent him to bleſſe you, in turning every one of you from his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi> Acts 3.24, 25. Therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to you and your children,</hi> he meaneth to the promiſe of Chriſt made to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Admit this be granted,</hi> what do you gather from thence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I gather this, as that promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed was the ground formerly on which the Lord did build the command to circumciſe father and child in all the time of that adminiſtration: So the Apoſtle doth ſpeak to theſe Jewes who had crucified Chriſt, that if they would receive him as the particular Meſſiah, the ſame promiſe ſhould ſtill continue to them and their children in the new diſpenſation. And on this doth he build the word of command to baptize father &amp; child.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you do here argue from infant-Circumciſion unto infant-Baptiſme: by this way of reaſoning why do you not plead the Baptiſme of the males only? Why do you not plead for the particular eight day, and ſo carry the wholy analogy together?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do not argue from the bare analogy of Circumciſion, but herein lyeth the force of my reaſon, becauſe the promiſe is, one and the ſame in the laſt exhibition to beleevers and their children as it was in the times of Circumciſion, the ſame word of promiſe exhibited in the laſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117779:14"/>times doth draw in the word of command to baptize father and child. And this I ſtand upon is the ſence of <hi>Peter</hi> in the words of the Text. For the particular of the Males, the eight day, and ſuch like circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it doth not hold in theſe, as in that one particular of infancie. Theſe (as all know) are of a periſhing nature, but for the particular of infancy, becauſe the promiſe to beleevers &amp; their children doth hold from age to age, from beleevers of the Jewes to beleevers of the Gentiles; from belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the time of the Circumciſion to beleevers in the times of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; Becauſe the promiſe doth ſtill hold one and the ſame in ſubſtance to beleevers and their children in the laſt diſpenſation. Upon this ground doth the Apoſtle build the word of command, <hi>be baptized every one of you, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore the word of promiſe to the children, now in the laſt exhibition, doth bring in the word of command, to baptize infants, or to baptize in infancie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Well, let it be admitted that the promiſe is to beleevers and their children, now in the laſt diſpenſation, it maketh not to the purpoſe, for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To as many as the Lordour God ſhall call,</hi> therefore the promiſe ſhall belong to them and to their children at the time of the call only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I yeeld that they that live in Gentiliſme or Judaiſme muſt be called before the promiſe, and the Seale may he rightly applyed to them; but the queſtion is when they are once called, when they once receive the Chriſt come in the fleſh, is not the promiſe to them and their children in the laſt as well as in the two former exhibitions? I do affirme that the promiſe in the laſt exhibition doth appertain to beleevers and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as long as they are no worſe then ſuch before the time of their call. For
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, the natural ſeed of beleevers were called children of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in all the time of the former diſpenſation, and that before calling, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.24, 25. How then can the promiſe in the times of the Goſpel appertaine to the children only at the time of their call?</item>
                  <item>Secondly, how can the Apoſtle avouch that the ſame promiſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers and their children, that the ſame promiſe in ſubſtance, as to the children, doth deſcend out of the times of Circumciſion into the times of Baptiſme; if the promiſe, as to the children, in the times of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ſhall be limited and circumſcribed to the time of the call onely?</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, what encouragement is this to them he ſpake to, that they ſhould leave the Old to come under the New Adminiſtration? This were no encouragement if the promiſe to the children under the New Adminiſtration ſhould belong to them at the time of the call only?</item>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:117779:15"/>
                  <item>Fourthly, what peculiar priviledge doth he promiſe to the children of Beleevers more then to the children of Pagans? ſith the promiſe ſhall be to the children of Pagans at the time of their calling. The promiſe, as to the children of Beleevers, by this account will be juſt nothing at all.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, when he ſaith <hi>as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> this doth relate to the words going before <hi>(to them that are afarre off,)</hi> to wit, to the Gentiles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. When it ſhall pleaſe the Lord our God to call them, to wit, the Gentiles out of paganiſme, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as exhibited in the laſt times, ſhall be to them and their children, as formerly it was to beleevers amongſt the Jewes to them and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their own diſpenſation. This is the meaning of the text, that the promiſe doth belong to the children of Beleevers, whether Jewes or Gentiles, whether in the ſecond or in the third diſpenſation, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe doth belong to the children when the parents come to embrace the faith. On this ground doth the Apoſtle urge the word of command to father and child, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> and this I take to be the true meaning of the text.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. So you ſay, but what ſufficient reaſon can you bring to aſſure the conſcience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which doth much aſſure me is the Apoſtles own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation in the chapter following, for there he ſhoweth that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the particular family of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall be applyed to all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving families, kindreds, and nations of the earth, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25, 26. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. Now what is this but that the promiſe ſhall be one and the ſame to them that beleeve among the Gentiles and their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as to them that did beleeve among the Jewes and their families. He doth not ſpeak onely of Beleevers in perſon, but of Beleevers and their children; why elſe doth he ſay concerning Chriſt, the promiſed ſeed, all the families ſhall be bleſſed in him? Why elſe doth he uſe this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>But that the promiſe now in the laſt times is ſtill one and the ſame to Beleevers and their families?</hi> On this ground doth he build the word of command to the parents that did beleeve and to their children, <hi>Be baptized every one of you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>If this be the meaning of the command, why is there no more frequent mention of the Baptiſme of children in the New Teſtament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe the Apoſtles after the giving forth of the commiſſion had principally to deal with the Jewes, to bring them out of Judaiſme, and with the Gentiles to bring them out of Gentiliſme, their work did lye eſpecially in this, For this cauſe we read more often of the Baptiſme
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117779:15"/>of ſuch that did beleeve and profeſſe in their own perſon. Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we find it again and again repeated in the ſtory of the N. Teſtament, that ſuch and ſuch a one beleeveth, and was baptized, he and his houſe. So farre therefore as I can diſcern, the ordinary baptizing of houſholds in thoſe dayes is a plain example to illuſtrate the word of command in the Apoſtles words, to baptize beleevers and their children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. For the baptiſme of houſholds though we do read this again and again repeated, yet we are to underſtand it of ſuch only that did make out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, The Apoſtles did baptize ſuch as did profeſſe in their own perſons, yet they did baptize the houſholds, in relation to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers engagement. For the proof of this I do offer theſe enſuing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Firſt, it was the general practiſe of the Church going before when the father did beleeve and profeſſe, he was received with his houſhold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. Therefore when the Apoſtles did baptize in the new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, we can conceive no other but they did follow the common uſe in receiving the father that did beleeve with his children. Secondly, when they did preach the Goſpel they did bring the bleſſing of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> into the beleeving families of the earth. If they did this, they muſt needs in the laſt diſpenſation apply the promiſe and the ſeale gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to all beleeving families of the earth, in the ſame manner as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it was applyed to the particular family of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now what is this but to take in the profeſſing parent with his children? Thirdly, in thoſe times thoſe that were brought out of Judaiſme or Paganiſme did at the time of their entrance into the Church make a ſolemne league and covenant with God to profeſſe the faith, they and their families, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4. Therefore when the Apoſtles did baptize the houſholds of beleevers, we cannot conceive that they did this only in relation to ſome perſons that made actual profeſſion, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the fathers ingagement that did undertake for himſelf and for his children. Fourthly, they that ſay the Apoſtles did baptize the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and ſuch in the houſholds only as did actually beleeve and profeſſe, they that ſay this let them ſhow a reaſon why the houſhold of <hi>Lydia</hi> was baptized; for we read only of her that the Lord opened her heart to beleeve the Chriſt. If you will ſay that her family was baptized in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to her undertaking, then the reaſon will lye cleare in the text, <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia was judged faithful to the Lord, and ſo was baptized, ſhe and her houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. Acts.</hi> 16.14.</p>
            <p>All theſe reaſons put together plainly demonſtrate the Apoſtolical practiſe to baptize beleevers houſholds, in relation to their undertaking
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117779:16"/>for themſelves and for their children. If this be ſo, there muſt needs be an example to anſwer the Apoſtolical precept; <hi>Be baptized every one of you (Father and Child) for the Promiſe is to you and to your children.</hi> And ſo from the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> compared with the practiſe of other Apoſtles, we have both a precept and an example for the Baptiſme of Children in the New-Teſtament, and (as I think) our task is done. I come now to the third Scripture to prove the neceſſity of Infant-baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the conference with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> our Saviour doth inſiſt much upon the pollution of the Naturall birth, and the neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, both by Water without, and the Spirit within. Now in this Scripture there is included a Precept to Beleevers to apply the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward waſhing to their Children (born in Originall ſinne) the Seal of the inward waſhing. That this may bee made manifeſt I will
<list>
                  <item>Firſt clear the Text from two ordinary miſtakes.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, from the words rightly expounded, I will ſhow how the precept is deduced by neceſſary conſequence.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the miſtaks, in the firſt place they do over ſhoot themſelves that plead from hence an abſolute neceſſitie of the Baptiſme of infants. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is an abſolute neceſſitie that all that are borne in Originall ſinne, if they be ſaved, they muſt be ſaved by the Covenant, but there is not a like neceſſitie of the Seal. In the times of the firſt diſpenſation to comfort Beleevers in reſpect of their Children born in Originall ſinne, the promiſe then was, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi> Gen. 3.15. Yet there was no Seal of this Promiſe, no initiall Seal for two thouſand years together, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Further there was not ſuch abſolute neceſſity of the Seal in the times of Circumciſion for thoſe that died before the eight day.</p>
            <p>There was then (as now is,) an abſolute neceſſity of Salvation by the Promiſe and the Covenant: but the neceſſity of the Seal was only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, ſo far forth as it might be well had. Therefore, when the ancient Writers (Fathers and Schoolmen) ſpeak ſo much of <hi>the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Baptiſme,</hi> and of the Salvation of Infants, ſtrictly and preciſely upon terms of Baptiſme, to my underſtanding they aſcribe too much to the outward Ordinance, and ſo do erre in the other extreme. For the hope of Salvation doth not lye ſo much in the Seal, as in the Promiſe to which the Seal is annexed. Indeed the Lord having made a Promiſe, to Beleevers concerning their Children born in Originall ſinne, <hi>That he will be their God and the God of their ſeed,</hi> in this caſe they muſt beleeve his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117779:16"/>word, and where he hath ordained a Seal for the confirmation of their Faith, they muſt take heed how they neglect to apply it, they muſt not (as more then too many do in theſe dayes) think it a ſuperfluous, or an idle figure. All that we plead is this, that there is a neceſſity that lyeth upon beleeving Parents to baptize their Children born in Originall ſinne. But how? the neceſſity is not abſolute but conditionall. In caſe the Child dye before Baptiſme, he may be ſaved by the Covenant and by the Promiſe of God; yet I think ſuch a Parent that doth careleſly omit his duty, he will very hardly anſwer his neglect to God himſelf, his Church, and I think at laſt to his own conſcience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To my underſtanding alſo they go too far, whoſoever they be that do conclude that Baptiſme doth Regenerate, or that it doth confer grace by the work done. It is a difficult point rightly to divide the matter between two extremes. If therefore I may deliver my thoughts concerning this matter, I do beleeve that as the Word preached, ſo the Seals adminiſtred, according to the minde of Chriſt, in this they are the conduit pipes to carry the Spirit into the ſoules of men. But how? not alwayes, in all men, and at all times; but only when it pleaſeth the Lord to work by them. But as to the particular of Baptiſme, what that Ordinance doth conferre we will reſolve, in anſwering theſe ſeverall Quaeries.</p>
            <p>Quaer. 1. <hi>What doth Baptiſme conferre to the pardon of Originall ſinne in Infants?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is certain all that are born in the ordinary way ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> are born in the guilt of Originall ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.13, 14. Now this is the comfort to Beleevers, that in Chriſt the promiſed Seed there is pardon of this ſinne to their naturall Seed. Therefore if the Children of Beleevers dye before Baptiſme, there is hope of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Promiſe: But if they dye after Baptiſme, the hope is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded upon the Promiſe, but it is alſo ratifyed by the Seal. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Infants that dye unbaptized, the hope of their Salvation is by Promiſe; but the baptized Infants of beleevers have hope of Salvation both by Promiſe and by Seal. Thus far (as I conceive) Baptiſme doth conferre to the pardon of Originall ſin in Infants.</p>
            <p>Quaer. 2. <hi>What doth Baptiſme conferre to the pardon of Actuall ſinne in men of ripe years?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a ſure rule, that Baptiſme doth not only Seal the pardon of Originall, but alſo the pardon of Actuall ſinne, <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaid to <hi>Paul, Why tarrieſt thou? ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſinnes, calling upon the name of the Lord. Act.</hi> 22.16. So then, if the perſon baptized
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117779:17"/>continue after Baptiſme in clenſing and purging out of ſinne, in judging and condemning himſelf daily for ſin, he may be fully aſſured that the Lord will continue a daily pardon of ſinne. As ſinne is daily confeſſed, ſo it ſhall be daily pardoned upon true confeſſion. If any doubt ſhould ariſe in the Conſcience concerning the continuation of pardon by the blood of Chriſt, whether the Lord would continue to pardon ſuch ſinne as is committed after juſtification, the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>If we confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes, and to clenſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. Why doth he ſay that he is faithfull and juſt to forgive ſinne? This doth imply that he hath ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where bound himſelf by Promiſe to forgive ſin to them that truly repent. It is true, he hath bound himſelf to the Perſon baptized, at the time of Baptiſme to forgive and to pardon ſinne, ſo far forth as ſinne is repented of. The Perſon baptized may ſay, I am aſſured of this, I have had it Sealed to me fourty, fifty, ſixty years ago, at the time of my Baptiſme. Where the Conſcience doth make a queſtion, whether God will continue to pardon ſinne; the waſhing of Baptiſme doth Seal the aſſurance thereof.</p>
            <p>Quaer. 3. <hi>What doth Baptiſme confer to the taking away of the pollution of Originall ſin in Infants?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Everard,</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 127.) of late do ſtrongly diſpute, that Children have no naturall pollution derived from <hi>Adam;</hi> yet in this we cannot yeeld to them. It is plaine from the Scope of Scripture that aſſoone as men have a being, they have a polluted and a ſinfull being. In caſe therefore they die in infancie, how is this pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution done away? In this we leave them to the extraordinarie grace of God. He can clenſe them in an extraordinarie way whom he will not ſuffer to come in the ordinary way to Salvation. And this is all that we will ſay of that Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Quaer. 4. <hi>What doth Baptiſme confer to the taking away of the pollution of Nature in men of ripe years?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is plaine by experience that all that are baptized, are not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate: Therefore we cannot look upon Baptiſme, but only as on a Seal of Regeneration. Foraſmuch as the Lord for his part doth promiſe to give his Spirit to the Perſon baptized that he may be regenerated; The Perſon baptized for his part doth ſolemnly ingage himſelf, that he will look for the Spirit which the Lord hath promiſed to give, that ſo he may come to the inward waſhing. In this (as I conceive) the efficacy and the uſe of Baptiſme doth principally ſtand. It doth principally ſtand in the agreement betwixt God and the Beleever, the Lord for his part,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117779:17"/>in the firſt place, under his Seal, doth promiſe to give inward grace to the clenſing away of the pollution of Nature; and the partie baptized doth ſet to his Seal, that he will endeavour to clenſe and waſh, by the power and help of grace received. The reaſon that moveth me ſo to think, is this. When the Lord ſaith, <hi>Circumciſe the foreskin of your hearts, and be no more ſtiff-necked.</hi> Deut. 10.16. Here if you go ſtrictly to work, how could he require the circumciſing of the heart, as ſpirituall and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall duty, how could he require this to be performed by weak and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men? To ſpeak truly, in all the time of that adminiſtration he did never require them to circumciſe the foreskin of their hearts by their own naturall ability; but he required them to look to the Promiſe ſealed to them in the outward Circumciſion of the fleſh. Becauſe he required them to circumciſe the foreskin of their heart in the word of Command, He doth ſay, <hi>I will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed in the word of Promiſe,</hi> Deut. 30.6. And therefore the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> finding by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that he was conceived in ſin, and born in iniquity, he did pray to the Lord, that he would create in him a clean heart, and renew within him a right Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5, 10. In this he did but pray for the inward circumciſion of the heart, according to the word of Promiſe, to which he had already obliged and bound himſelf to look after in the time of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumciſion. The like reaſon may be given of the times of the New-Teſtament, where the Lord doth command us <hi>to be renewed in the ſpirit of our mindes, to waſh, to clenſe our ſelves from all pollution of fleſh and ſpirit.</hi> In this caſe we are not to take it as though we had an inward power to waſh or clenſe our mindes, but we are to conſider when the Lord doth lay ſuch a Command upon us, it is in correſpondence and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Promiſe ſealed in the Sacrament of Baptiſme. Becauſe he hath promiſed to give his Spirit inwardly to waſh and clenſe our Natures when we receive the outward waſhing, we for our parts do oblige and bind our ſelves, inwardly to waſh by and through the ſupply of his holy Spirit. Therefore, to ſhut up all, though Baptiſme doth not confer Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet by that Ordinance the Lord doth bind himſelf to give his Spirit toward that inward Regeneration, ſo far forth as we do and ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to look after his Promiſe.</p>
            <p>And thus far I have gone in clearing the Text from two great miſtakes. I do not plead from the words <hi>(except ye be born of Water and of the Spirit)</hi> an abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſme by the outward Element of Water, but only a conditionall. I do not plead that all who are outwardly baptized, are inwardly Regenerated: But that the Lord doth enter into Covenant with them to give his regenerating Spirit, ſo far forth as they look and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117779:18"/>wait for it in the uſe of thoſe means which he hath appointed. This is all that I do deſire to ſpeak concerning this matter, and I do it the rather, becauſe I would not give offence. I hope then that I ſhall be more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly heard when I prove a precept both for the Baptiſme of Infants, and for the neceſſity of their Baptiſme from this Scripture.</p>
            <p>The probation of the Precept doth lye in two particulars: Firſt, by Water, is meant the outward water in Baptiſme, as it doth referre to the inward waſhing of the Spirit. Secondly, becauſe children are born in Originall ſinne, there doth lye a neceſſity upon the Parents to bring them to Baptiſme, the Seal of their Regeneration.</p>
            <p>That the outward Baptiſme of Water is here meant, the reaſons that move me ſo to judge are theſe: Firſt, the generall conſent of all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; together with many late Writers, agree in it, that the externall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie Baptiſme is here intended as a Seal of the inward waſhing. Secondly, it is more immediate to the words of the Text to take the waſhing of water as the outward ſigne, and the waſhing of the Spirit as the inward grace. Thirdly, other places of Scripture do carrie but one and the ſame ſence. The waſhing of Baptiſme is called the waſhing of Regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. And the reaſon is this, becauſe the inward waſhing of the Spirit in Regeneration, is ſealed with the outward waſhing in Baptiſme. Now is this all one with the birth by Water and by the Spirit? But if any man ſhall ſtand in it, that theſe and many other Scriptures cannot be meant of water-Baptiſme, then I would intreat him to ſhow me the reaſon why the work of Regeneration in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is ſo often called by the title, and by the name of waſhing? There is a purging by fire, ſo mettalls are refined; <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.3. There is a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by wind, ſo the corn is clenſed; <hi>Math.</hi> 3.12. Why then is the clenſing, and purging, and the inward renewing of the heart ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth by the waſhing of water? I think all will eaſily agree in it, becauſe the outward waſhing is appointed as a Seal of the inward waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the new birth. If this be ſo, the birth by water muſt needs refer to the water of Baptiſme as to the outward ſigne. Fourtly, that which hath moved ſome late Writers to depart from this interpretation, for the reaſon that hath moved them, we can clearly make it appear, that other Scriptures have the like ſhow of dfficultie of which no queſtion is to be made but they ſpeak of outward Baptiſme. If ſome of them apprehend that the preſent text, <hi>(Except a man be borne of water and of the ſpirit)</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of outward baptiſme, becauſe then the baptiſme of water would be abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation. He that is troubled with this difficulty, let him conſider that place, <hi>He that beleeveth and is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117779:18"/>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.16. In theſe words no man doubteth but the Lord Chriſt doth point to the outward baptiſme by water, and in a ſort he doth ſay that this baptiſme is neceſſary to ſalvation. How then are the words to be expounded? We muſt take them in this ſence, that faith is more abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, yet in a ſort it is true, that baptiſme is neceſſary as the outward meane; Why elſe ſhould our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſay, <hi>He that beleeveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> We may in the preſent caſe give the ſame expoſition. According to the manifeſt courſe of divine diſpenſation, we come to ſalvation by the new birth, and in the ordinary way ſo farre as it may conveniently be had, the outward waſhing is a ſeale of the inward waſhing of the Spirit. Theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more reaſons might be brought to prove that the outward Baptiſme is intended in the words, <hi>Except a man be borne of water and of the Spirit.</hi> But in ſo plaine a caſe theſe ſhall ſuffice. Now we come to prove the Precept.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If it be granted that the outward elementary baptiſme is here intended, I think it will eaſily follow, in the conſcience of every belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parent, that there is a neceſſity lyeth upon him to bring his child to baptiſme. For if the Lord Chriſt that giveth ſalvation, doth require the outward baptiſme of Water, and the inward baptiſme of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, both theſe as the ordinary meane to ſalvation in ſuch a caſe for a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that is mindful of the ſalvation of his infant, it is not for him cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to diſpute, whether an Infant unbaptized may be ſaved? But it lyeth upon him to do that which is required, and ſo to avoid the danger. But let us more particularly inſiſt upon the Baptiſme of Infants, the word of command muſt neceſſarily be applyed, becauſe of the pollution of their natural birth. The ſcope of the text is chiefly concerning theſe three particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, that all by nature are defiled with Original ſin:</item>
               <item>Secondly, there is a neceſſity of the new birth.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, the outward waſhing in baptiſme is a ſeale of the inward waſhing.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This being laid as a ground, that the Infant is borne in Original ſin, and that the outward baptiſme is a ſeale of the waſhing away of the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſin by the Spirit of Chriſt; upon ſuch a ſuppoſition I think we may not uſe many arguments to the beleeving parent, to bring his Infant to the waſhing of baptiſme. No man can be ignorant, where the diſeaſe is, there is a need of the remedy. And therefore when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth preſſe a neceſſity of waſhing both by Water and the Spirit, he doth not urge this ſo immediatly in reference to actual ſinne, as in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117779:19"/>to birth-ſinne, and to the naturall pollution in which infants are born. The conſideration of the guilt, and the pollution of the birth-ſin, doth draw in the neceſſitie of Infant-Baptiſme. And therefore in the former ages of the Church we ſhall find all along that they that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the vileneſſe of the naturall pollution, (as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and others) they were more forward for baptiſme in infancie. On the other ſide, thoſe that thought infants to be free from all Originall pollution, as derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> (for of this Judgment were the Pelagians of old and Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> and his followers of late) they both were and now are moſt laxe and careleſſe in the performance of that dutie to their own children.</p>
            <p>But if this will not convince, let it be conſidred in the feare of God, wherefore there was ſuch a ſtrict command given to the Jewes to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their infants in their diſpenſation. If the like reaſon doth hold that Infants have now one and the ſame need of the ſeal of the new-birth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this laſt, aſwell as they had under their diſpenſation, why ſhould not parents now make the ſame conſcience to bring their children to the ſeal of regeneration or the new birth now as well as then.</p>
            <p>That the Lord did ſo ſtrictly command circumciſion, and that the foreskin ſhould be cut off, by this the Jewiſh infant did declare, that the verie nature was defiled which he received by carnall generation from his parents, and which by generation he was like to traduce and conveigh unto his children. By this the Jewiſh infant did ſignifie the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his naturall birth, and that he needed to have Originall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the uncircumciſion of the fleſh to be done away by the Spirit of Chriſt. Now is not the caſe all one with the Chriſtian Infants born in Originall ſin? have not they the ſame need of the waſhing of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whereof the waſhing in Baptiſme is a Seal? The reaſon being the ſame, I know nothing to the contrary but that a Beleever in the laſt diſpenſation, may take theſe words <hi>(Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit)</hi> as a Precept for Infant-Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Now that Circumciſion in the former, and Baptiſme in the latter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, do point to one and the ſame thing, to the clenſing away of the pollution of the naturall birth by the Spirit of Chriſt, we have a clear teſtimony for this from <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. In the words immediatly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Apoſtle did exhort them, <hi>beware leſt any man ſpoyle you through</hi> Philoſophy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By <hi>Philoſophy</hi> we are not to underſtand the ſpurious and the baſtard kind, but he doth mean the beſt Ethicall <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> when men put it in the place of a <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The principles of the beſt <hi>Philoſophy</hi> are theſe, <hi>That a man new born into the world is like a white ſheet of Paper; that he hath no Originall pollution;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117779:19"/>that he hath in him the ſeed of all morality; that he hath liberty of will; that the habite of vertue is attainable by the repetition of many acts.</hi> Theſe are the cheif elements of the beſt morall <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Now the Apoſtle ſhoweth that theſe Rudiments of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> are moſt deſtructive to the faith of Chriſt. For the prime foundation of the Chriſtian faith, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily to beleeve that all are defiled with Originall ſinne by the naturall birth, that there is no other way of clenſing but by the regenerating ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt. For the conſirmation of this he doth referre them to the firſt Rudiments of Baptiſme in this laſt, and of Circumciſion in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſpenſation. For circumciſion, he ſaith in effect, that the foreskin of the fleſh was cut off, to ſignifie the putting away of the uncircumciſion of the fleſh in the heart. <hi>Ye alſo are circumciſed with a Circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the luſts of the fleſh by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt.</hi> And for Baptiſme he ſaith in effect, that they were douſed and waſhed in water, to ſignifie the waſhing and clenſing of the naturall birth by the regenerating ſpirit of Chriſt. Therefore Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Baptiſme do both agree in this, that Infants are born in their naturall pollution, and that this pollution is only to be done away by the clenſing vertue of the holy Spirit. Therefore if any man demand of us a Precept for the Baptiſme of Infants; I cannot ſee but in a ſence it is true that the ſame neceſſity doth lie upon us to baptize our Infants born in Originall ſinne, as did upon them to circumciſe. For though we are not to follow the Jew in things peculiar to his own diſpenſation; yet thoſe actions that are done by him upon ſuch grounds that are of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, perpetuall, and common concernment to one perſon aſwell as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to one Church aſwell as another, in one age aſwell as another, none can deny theſe actions to be obligatory to all as a ſtanding Rule for after generations. Therefore ſeeing the birth in Originall ſinne, and the clenſing of nature by the Spirit of Chriſt, are of common concernment to the Jewiſh and to the Chriſtian Infants, there is a morality in it, that our Infants ſhould be made partakers of the Seal of Regeneration in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy as well as theirs. If the reaſon did not hold one and the ſame, ſomething might be ſaid to the contrary; But ſeeing that Infants are now born in Originall ſinne, and Baptiſme is now alſo the Seal of the new-Birth, I cannot ſee but the ſame neceſſity in ſubſtance, as upon them to Circumciſe, ſo it doth lie upon Beleevers now to baptize their infants. The neceſſity (ſo farre as I apprehend) doth lie couched in theſe words, <hi>Except ye be born of Water and of the Spirit:</hi> Therefore Infants, being involved in their naturall pollution, have now a need of the Seal of the new-Birth.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:117779:20"/>
            <p>But if all this will not ſatisfie, I will come to the Original Promiſe in the inſtitution of circumciſion. The promiſe is contained in theſe words, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed,</hi> Gen. 17.7. Here (I ſay) how could God be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his natural ſeed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is no better by nature then the reſt of the loſt ſons of men? ſeeing the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt needs be brought forth in Original ſin, how could God be a God to ſuch a polluted ſeed, that had equally the pollution of the whole corrupted maſſe? The anſwer is plain, that he did never make this promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeed, but with a double proviſo; the firſt is, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the grand promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Gen. 12.3 By the intervening or coming between of Chriſt the promiſed ſeed, <hi>Abraham</hi> was to look that God would be his God and the God of his natural ſeed. Secondly, when the Lord did promiſe to be his God, and the God of his ſeed, it was upon a condition that they would keep his Covenant, that they would confeſſe their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural pollution, and that by receiving the outward Circumciſion in the fleſh, they would binde and ingage themſelves and their children to look after the inward circumciſion of the heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.9, 10, 11, 12. with <hi>Ezek</hi> 44.9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.16, &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28. Upon theſe two conſiderations did the Lord promiſe to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his natural ſeed. Now if we apply this to the New Teſtament, the promiſe is ſtill one and the ſame to Beleevers and their children as it was to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his particular family; how elſe could this beright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is a God to Beleevers, and to their natural children in the laſt, upon the ſame termes as he was to Beleevers and their children in the former diſpenſation: and the termes are theſe, Firſt, that they beleeve the general promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> Acts 3.25, 26. By the intervening of this promiſe the bleſſing doth hold one and the ſame to all the beleeving families of the earth, as it did before to the particular family of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Secondly, the promiſe to beleevers and their children doth now hold upon theſe termes, that the parents by the outward waſhing in Baptiſme will ingage themſelves and their children to look after the inward waſhing, that ſo they may be cleanſed from the pollution of their natural birth. Upon theſe termes God is now a God to beleevers and their naturall ſeed, and upon theſe conſiderations there is now a neceſſity of precept to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize beleevers and their children. And this I take to be vertually included in that general expreſſion, <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:117779:20"/>
            <p>Thus I have gone through the three places of Scripture from which I did undertake to prove a precept for the baptiſme of infants in the New Teſtament. We have ſeen, firſt that the children are comprehended incluſively and collectively in the word <hi>(them) teach all Nations, baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them,</hi> Matth. 28. Secondly, we have declared that the children are contained in the word of command, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> becauſe they are expreſſed in the word of promiſe, Act. 2, 38, 39. Thirdly, we have proved, becauſe infants are born in Originall ſinne, they have now the ſame need of the regenerating ſeal by outward waſhing, <hi>Except ye be born of water and of the Spirit.</hi> John. 3.5.</p>
            <p>All theſe put together, plainly ſhow that there is a word of Command to ſatisfie the Conſcience; and though the Children are not named in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſyllables, it is all one if they be contained in ſence. There be many things comprehended in a Command that are not literally decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Take for example the Command <hi>Honour thy father and mother,</hi> there is more contained in this Precept then only to give honour to naturall Parents. So take the Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no murder;</hi> this doth reach further then the bare letter of the word. Even ſo in the Scriptures forealledged we have proved Infants to be vertually included in the word of Command, though they are not expreſſed in the formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of letters and ſyllables. But if you will ſay, the more literally and diſtinctly things are ſet down the more eaſily, we come to know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that theſe things are commanded us of God. This I did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be true in a ſence; but yet it is as true, that things which the Lord doth require us to beleeve from the harmony of Scripture, are as binding to the Conſcience, as if they were ſet down in ſo many letters. Let us take for inſtance that Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.21. where it is ſaid, <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>did confound the Jews dwelling at</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>proving out of the Scriptures that</hi> Jeſus <hi>was the</hi> Chriſt. Here I demand, how did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Jews aforeſaid? For if he had been put upon it to bring any one particular Scripture out of the Old Teſtament, to prove in ſo many letters that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he could never have done it. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe he is ſaid to confound the Jews by the harmony of Scripture, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) by comparing one Scripture with another. Further, we do aſſuredly beleeve, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> from that very time in which he was declared <hi>univerſall Head,</hi> from that very time he began to be the ſolemne Antichriſt ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> If a Papiſt ſhould ask how this is proved, we cannot prove it by letters and ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is not once named in ſo many letters, in the whole Prophecie; but if you go to the Scope of Scripture, it may be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117779:21"/>proved that he is the <hi>Beast,</hi> that the <hi>univerſall Headſhip</hi> is the name of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the profeſſion of the <hi>Catholiciſme</hi> or <hi>univerſall headſhip</hi> is the mark of the Name: and this we can prove from the harmonie of the Prophecie. In a word, they that will beleeve nothing but what is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſo many letters and ſyllables, they will by the ſame reaſon raze out of the Bible the uſe of all typicall Scriptures in a manner. For in them for the moſt part the matter is expreſſed by dark figures, and expounded by Circumlocutions. And to theſe abſurdities will they be unavoidably deduced that do adhere ſo ſtrictly to letter and ſyllables. Now let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Baptiſme of Infants, and here we truſt we have made it appear from the harmonie of Scripture, but eſpecially from the places forealledged, that there is a word of Command for the Baptiſme of Children. And I would intreat the godly to do as the men of <hi>Berca</hi> ſometimes did, <hi>To examine the Scriptures whether theſe things be ſo or no.</hi> Having finiſhed the Poſitive part I come now to the Polemical, to ſhow what the argument was which I firſt gave to the Brethren of the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as alſo to ſhow their ſeverall anſwers with my reſpective replyes.</p>
            <p>For the argument which I left with them in writing at <hi>Earle-Shilton</hi> from <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. It is as followeth;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be baptized every one of you,</hi> &amp;c. Here muſt needs be a Command to baptize Father and Child, becauſe the Promiſe is <hi>to you and your children.</hi> The argument doth thus proceed; If the Children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the word of Promiſe, they muſt have a right to be baptized by the word of Command; But the Children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: therefore the Children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the word of Command. And ſo conſequently there is a word of Command in the New Teſtament, to baptize Beleevers and their Children. The connexion is proved from the convertibility and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall relation between the word of Promiſe and the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and therefore if the Children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the one, they muſt have a right to be baptized by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The conſequence is clear: and for the aſſumption, it is proved by St. <hi>Peters</hi> own words, <hi>For the Promiſe is to you and your children.</hi> This is my argument.</p>
            <p>To this on the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> I received a certain Paper by way of anſwer, the ſubſtance of which was briefly this; <hi>For the convertibility of the word of Promiſe, and the word of Command, they ſaid I took it as granted, I had affirmed it only, but had not proved it; therefore there was no ſuch mutuall relation.</hi> And for the aſſumption, they ſaid <hi>that the Children of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117779:21"/>have no right to be baptized by the word of Promiſe, ſeeing that the Promiſe is meant only of extraordinary gifts.</hi> verſ. 16, 17. <hi>Seeing that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in theſe our dayes, are not capable of ſuch gifts, they knew no right they had to be baptized by vertue of that Promiſe.</hi> This was the ſubſtance of the Paper which they ſent to me on the firſt of <hi>May.</hi> And my returne to them on the third of <hi>June,</hi> was briefly this;</p>
            <p>Whereas they did deny the convertibility between the word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the word of Command, I did endeavour to prove it by theſe reaſons that follow.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, from particular examples; in the Sacrament of Circumciſion, the word of Promiſe is, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed;</hi> in relation to this Promiſe the Lord did command <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumciſe all his Males, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 8, 9. In this inſtitution there is a mutuall relation and convertibility between the word of Promiſe and the word of Command. For as many as had a right to be circumciſed by the word of Promiſe, had a right to be circumciſed by the word of Command. Again, as many as had a right to be circumciſed by the word of Command, had a right to be circumciſed by the word of Promiſe; there muſt needs be then a convertibility between theſe two in the Sacramentall action. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in the Inſtitution of the Paſſover, the Lord was pleaſed to make a gaacious promiſe to the children of <hi>Iſrael, When I ſee the blood, I will paſſe over you, and the plague ſhall not be upon you when I ſmite the land of Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12.13. In relation to this Promiſe the Lotd comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to take the blood, and to ſtrike it upon the two ſide-poſts and upon the upper door-poſts of the houſes where they ſhould eat the Lamb. This was a Type of Chriſt; where his blood is, there will be deliverance from wrath. Now in this as in the former inſtitution, there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertibility between the word of Promiſe and the word of Command. For as many as had a word of Promiſe to eſcape the plaguing Angel, had a word of command to ſtrike the blood upon the door-poſts. And as many as had a word of Command to ſtrick the blood upon the door-poſts, ſo many had a word of Promiſe to eſcape the plaguing Angel. The converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility between theſe two, might be further proved from ſuch Promiſes, which it hath pleaſed the Lord to ſignifie to the ſons of men by outward ſignes and figures. But theſe are ſufficient.</item>
               <item>Secondly, This is made manifeſt by the generall nature of Covenants between men and men. There muſt needs be a convertibility between theſe two parts that do contract, as may appear by the Indentures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. If this be ſo in the general nature of Covenants, it muſt neceſſarily hold in the Sacramental Covenant betwixt God and man.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117779:22"/>There muſt needs be between the word of Promiſe, which is Gods part, and the word of Command that doth contain the duty of man in the Sacramentall action, there muſt needs be (I ſay) between theſe two a near relation.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, this is evident from the very definition of a Sacrament; For the form and being of a Sacrament, by and through which it is defined, doth ſtand in the analogie, proportion, correſpondence, mutuall relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the outward ſigne, ſet forth in the word of Command, and the inward grace contained in the word of Promiſe. Now then, if there be no mutuall habitude and relation between theſe two, we ſhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the very being and form of a Sacrament.</item>
               <item>Fourthly, this doth appear from the weakneſſe of that which is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged to the contrary; and therefore though it may be true (as ſome ſay) that a Promiſe may be without a Seal; Yet when men have once put their Seal, it is neceſſary that there muſt be a correſpondence between the Seal and the Covenant. In like manner it is not abſolutely neceſſary that the Covenant of grace, or the word of Promiſe, ſhould be ſet forth by outward ſignes that appear to the ſences; yet the Lord having once in the word of Inſtitution, appointed the outward ſign to ſignifie the inward grace, in ſuch a caſe as this is, it is neceſſary that there ſhould be a mutuall relation between the word of Promiſe and the word of Command. They that deny this (to my underſtanding) do not only go againſt the experience of Beleevers, but alſo againſt the common ſenſe of men.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now to gather up all into one ſumme, it is clear; Firſt from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examples; Secondly, from the general nature of Covenants; Thirdly, from the definition of a Sacrament ſtanding in relation: Fourthly, from the weakneſſe of that which is uſually alledged to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. From all theſe it is evident that there is a mutuall relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the word of Promiſe and the word of Command. And ſo I came to confirm the union of the copulative propoſition. <hi>If the children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the word of Promiſe, they muſt have a right to be baptized by the word of Command.</hi> The conſequence is firme, and there is a neceſſary union between both parts. And thus I did endeavour to prove to the Brethren of the Separation, the truth of that which I did affirm. I came to the aſſumption.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas they ſay, <hi>the promiſe to you and your children, is meant principally of extraordinary gifts, and Infants in our dayes are not capable of theſe.</hi> For the more effectuall proof of the point I did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhow that this Promiſe could not only or principally be meant
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117779:22"/>of extraordinary gifts, but in a poſitive ſenſe it pointed to the Covenant of grace, and was the very promiſe made to <hi>Abraham.</hi> The arguments which I did alledge were theſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, <hi>If the promiſe to you and your children</hi> be only and principally meant of extraordinary gifts, let any man ſhow what kind of comfort this would miniſter to men of a troubled ſpirit, that they ſhould ſpeak with divers kinds of languages? What a weak ſupport would this be, if this be all the comfort contained in the Promiſe? On the contrary, if you take the Promiſe for the Covenant of grace, for the ordinary word of promiſe concerning free remiſſion of ſinne by the blood of Chriſt, ſealed in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, there is nothing more proper then to comfort a languiſhing ſpirit by ſuch a Promiſe.</item>
               <item>Secondly, if the Promiſe <hi>(to you and your children)</hi> be meant of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts, how will the parts of the Text agree with each other? The Apoſtle doth exhort them, <hi>be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſinne:</hi> And then he giveth this reaſon, <hi>for the Promiſe is to you and your children.</hi> If therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be meant only or principally of extraordinary gifts, then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> will ſtand in immediate relation to ſuch a Promiſe. And ſo the matter will come to this iſſue, that all that are baptized, and particularly they that renounce their old to take up a new Baptiſme, they will have a promiſe made to them and to their children, to ſpeak with divers kinds of languages. On the other ſide, if the Promiſe be taken for the Promiſe of Chriſt, and for remiſſion of ſinne by his blood, in this caſe it will be eaſie to ſhew the connexion of the words. For what can be more aptly ſpoken then this, <hi>Be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jeſus for the remiſſion of your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſinne; for the promiſe of the pardon of ſinne, by the blood of the Chriſt, doth belong to you and your children?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Thirdly, if <hi>the promiſe to you and your children</hi> be only meant of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts, how can the words of the Apoſtle be made good when he ſaith, <hi>to all that are afar off, to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call?</hi> Will any man avouch that to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, the Promiſe ſhall be to them and their children to ſpeak with divers kinds of tongues? then the Promiſe will be to all the Saints from the comming of Chriſt to the end of the world, that they ſhall ſpeak with divers kinds of languages. On the other ſide let the Promiſe be taken for that promiſe made to <hi>Abraham, In thy ſeed ſhall all the families of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> this Promiſe (at leaſt in the general priviledges, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, tenders, and workings,) doth paſſe to all that do beleeve and their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117779:23"/>children, whether they be near, as beleevers of the Jews; or whether they be afar off, as beleevers of the Gentiles: the Promiſe doth paſſe to all as long as they are no worſe then Beleevers Children. Theſe were the reaſons that moved me to affirm that the Promiſe <hi>(to you and your children)</hi> could not be meant of extraordinary gifts. Firſt, this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe alone could not comfort <hi>Peters</hi> hearers in their trouble. Secondly, it could not anſwer the word of Command, <hi>be baptized every one of you.</hi> Thirdly, it could not be ſaid to extend to as many as <hi>the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> On the other ſide, if this be applyed to the Covenant of grace, all circumſtances will agree that the Promiſe is to Beleevers and their Children: And to this doth the Apoſtle referre the word of Command to Fathers and Children, <hi>bee baptized every one of you.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the words, <hi>(Ye ſhall receive the holy Ghoſt)</hi> I confeſſe they are meant of extraordinary gifts, the appendant annexed to the primitive Baptiſme, which were peculiar to thoſe times of the Church only. For the Apoſtles having to do either with Gentiles, to bring them out of <hi>Paganiſme,</hi> or with Jews to bring them out of <hi>Judaiſme,</hi> theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts were given to men for their more abundant confirmation in that Faith which they were to receive. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44, 45, 46. <hi>with Acts</hi> 11.15, 16. This I do willingly confeſſe; but when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>for the Promiſe is to you and your children,</hi> he doth point here to the grand fundamental Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham; In thy ſeed ſhall all the families of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> His meaning, is that if theſe Jews, which had crucified <hi>Christ,</hi> would come in, and take him as the promiſed Seed, if they would take him as the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Promiſe ſhould ſtill continue to them and to their natural ſeed aſwell as in the former diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. This is his meaning when he ſaith, <hi>for the promiſe is to you and your Children,</hi> and in relation to this Promiſe, did he exhort them to be baptized Father and Child. Thus far I went in the vindication of both propoſitions, and in reſtoring of the force of my argument againſt the firſt aſſault. On the third of <hi>Junne</hi> I delivered the ſubſtance of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply into the hands of Mr. <hi>Everard;</hi> ſince that time he hath been known to me, and hath undertaken the matter. But to ſay the truth I received no anſwer from him till the fifth of <hi>September.</hi> Then I received a Paper, full fraught with ſcornfull language; and the next newes, (about three or four weekes after,) was that we had put his anſwer in print with a title prefixed, <hi>Baby Baptiſme routed.</hi> In this I take my ſelf to have none of the beſt uſage from him. Firſt, that he ſhould put the matter publickly. In print, when wee were onely in a private way of inquirie.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117779:23"/>Secondly, that he ſhould give his pamphlet the title of <hi>Baby Baptiſme routed,</hi> before we came to the tryall. Thirdly, that he ſhould ſlight the maine body of my paper, with all the inforcements, and yet glory of a totall conqueſt, when of many parts he had ſcarce brought one to the incounter. For theſe reaſons I think he hath not delt well with me. Becauſe his Book was lately printed for WILLIAM LEARNER <hi>at the Blackmoor in Biſhopſ-gate ſtreet,</hi> and becauſe now it is in the hands of all men, I will forbear to inſert it. Only my reply to the cheif particulars of his anſwer, is as followeth.</p>

               <p>GOod Sir, ſince the arrivall of your anſwer I have taken it into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and ſo far as I apprenend, it may be conveniently divided into three parts.</p>

                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, you would bear me in hand that the ſtructure of it is not good; and that the premiſes do not hold due proportion with the concluſion.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, you do lay down terms of conſent, how far we agree; and terms of diſſent, how far we diſagree. <hi>And ſo state the Queſtion in the cloſe of all.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Sir, This is a ſtrange kind of method that hath been in part the cauſe of your <hi>Wilde Diſcourſe.</hi> Yet nevertheleſſe, as the courſe of the matter doth require, I will only take the liberty to lay down the ſtate of the Queſtion, as you your ſelf do expreſſe it in your own words. <hi>pag.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Stephens, <hi>That there is a Convertibility in Gods word, whether it be in Promiſe or Command, ſhall never by me be denyed; therefore I ſhall not only grant it, but maintain it. Becauſe all the words of God are ſacred, or holy and righteous altogether: therefore I hope we differ not concerning the congruity of Gods Promiſes and Commands; for doubtleſſe there is an harmonie: But here is the difference, I deny that there is any word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that ever God gave to baptize Beleevers Infants, or any word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for that purpoſe. For if there were a right by Promiſe or Command, then we ſhould grant that Children ought to have it. But becauſe there is no right, neither by Promiſe nor Command, therefore we deny the Infants
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117779:24"/>of Beleevers Baptiſme, &amp;c.</hi> And thus farre you have ſpoken.</p>
               <p>From theſe words of yours I gather, that there is a convertibility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the word of Promiſe and the word of Command. You ſay, <hi>that you will not only grant it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>but alſo maintain it.</hi> Sir. What is this, but in ſenſe to yeeld the maine conſequence of my Argument? This is the force of my reaſon, <hi>If the children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the word of Promiſe, they muſt have a right to be baptized by the word of Command.</hi> In this caſe ſeeing you deny not the convertibility between the Promiſe and Command of God, you do in effect allow the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Therefore all the burden of the proof doth lye upon the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Whether the children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the word of Promiſe?</hi> If this can be proved, we ſhall eaſily draw in the right of Baptiſme by the word of Command, in caſe the Premiſes be true; The one by your own grant, and the other by neceſſary conſequence; I hope then it is reaſonable that I ſhould carry the concluſion. Seeing you ſpeak of the ſticking of the Chariot wheels, that you cannot drive on, nor many thouſands to Infant-baptiſme: If you ſtick anywhere, your muſt ſtick at the word of Promiſe. Sir, Your cheif buſineſſe had been to overthrow the right that Beleevers children have to Baptiſme by the word of Promiſe in the laſt exhibition thereof. If you had done this, you had performed the work in two cheif points.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, You had reſolved me in point of conſcience; for I will aſſure you, that which moves me to beleeve that theſe words <hi>(be baptized eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you)</hi> are a Command to baptize Father and Child, is the near relation that they have to the words that follow; <hi>For the promiſe is to you and your children.</hi> Becauſe the Children are expreſſed in the word of Promiſe, they are contained in the word of Command. And for my part, I dare not (however you falſly accuſe me) tear aſunder the Promiſe from the Command, or the Command from the Promiſe in <hi>Peters</hi> words. You know that there is a curſe that belongs to them that do adde to or take from the word of God. You your ſelf have applyed it to them that do <hi>clip and cut, and tear aſunder the foregoing words of</hi> Peter <hi>from thoſe that follow after.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, Had you ſpent your force upon this Propoſition, to wit, <hi>That the children of beleevers have a right to Baptiſme by the word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> Had you taken this away, you had taken away the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. As long therefore as this is a firme truth, <hi>That the children have a right to be baptized by the word of Promiſe, in its laſt and beſt exhibition;</hi> I will ask you no beleef for the right to Baptiſme by the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The right to be baptized by the word of Command is the truth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117779:24"/>of the concluſion: Now <hi>ſuch a Logician you are to</hi> ſpend your whole an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in a manner upon the deny all of the Concluſion. You inſiſt much upon my tearing aſunder the Command, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> from the words, <hi>Repent and — be baptized.</hi> If theſe words be torn aſunder, it is to hold correſpondence with the words that follow; <hi>For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to you and your Children.</hi> But Sir (whatſoever you ſuggeſt to the contrary) I truſt I ſhall ſhow that I do not tear theſe words aſunder, if you go to the right ſenſe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Further, it is manifeſt from your own grants and conceſſions, that the foregoing anſwer of your Brethren is of no value at all. They deny a Convertibility between Gods word of Promiſe, and his word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; you allow it: They hold the Promiſe <hi>(to you and your children) to be meant of extraordinary gifts,</hi> and you ſay that one word in their vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, whether ſuch a promiſe is principally intended, yea or no. Thus, you who are ſo earneſt to deny the Baptiſme of Infants, and the uſe of the Church, the world may ſee how well you agree among your ſelves.</p>
               <p>But leaving that which may be gathered from your own grants and conceſſions, I will now come to the points of difference as they lie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between us. To begin therefore with your reaſons, by and through which you endeavour to prove that my argument is not rightly grounded on <hi>Peters</hi> words. If I may be ſo bold with your Method, that which you have ſaid, may be reduced to theſe five heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, You endeavour to ſhow that I tear the words of <hi>Peter;</hi> the words <hi>be baptized every one of you</hi> from the words <hi>Repent and</hi>—.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, You ſay that theſe words <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſpoken to Infants, as being not capable of ſuch a command.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, You affirme that the Perſons to whom <hi>Peter</hi> directed his ſpeech, were no Beleevers. If the Parents themſelves were no Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, their Children could not be the Children of Beleevers.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, You endeavour to ſhow that ſeeing the promiſe <hi>to you and your children,</hi> did belong to the whole Jewiſh nation, why was not the whole nation baptized?</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, Like a compaſſionate man, you conclude with advice, that I carrie my argument to ſome other Text, ſeeing it can have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef from <hi>Peters</hi> words. This Sir, (ſetting aſide your jeeres and mocks) is the pith of your anſwer. I ſhall therefore deſire to bring the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned particulars into queſtion, and to go along with you point by point.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To begin therefore with the firſt particular, <hi>viz. my tearing aſunder
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117779:25"/>the words of Peter,</hi> I do willingly agree, that whoſoever readeth the words of the Apoſtle, he is not to pluck them out of joynt, not to tear out the middle of the verſe where the words have a neceſſary dependance. I do agree in the generall truth with you, that the foregoing words are not to be torn aſunder from thoſe that follow. But whether this is done by you or by me, let that now come to the tryall. You ſtand upon it (<hi>pag.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.) that I do pluck aſunder the words, <hi>be baptized e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of you</hi> from the words <hi>repent and</hi>— Sir, if you go to words and ſyllables, and to literall formes of expreſſion, I have ſaid, and do ſay, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> is a word of Command to beleeving Parents and their Children; but that I tear theſe words from the true ſenſe and meaning of <hi>Peter,</hi> this I deny. For in a federall or covenant ſenſe, the children are ſaid to repent in their Parents that do undertake for them. And therefore if you will have the Text to be read according to <hi>Peters</hi> true meaning, it muſt runne after this tenour; <hi>Be baptized eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you [and your children,] for the promiſe is to you and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> According to this conſtruction the children may be ſaid to repent, and Covenant with God in their Parents, and the Parents may be ſaid to Covenant for their Children. If this be ſo, you may eaſily diſcerne, that the words <hi>(be baptized every one of you) are not plucked and torne from Repent and</hi>—</p>
               <p>Now that the Children may be ſaid to repent, to profeſſe, to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, either with or in their Parents, I can bring many proofs for the ſame out of Scripture. If I can prove this, I hope you will have no ſuch cauſe to accuſe me of felony, of ſtealing the words <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> from the words <hi>Repent and.</hi>— You might have ſpared your paines to come after me with a printed <hi>Hu-an-cry</hi> (as you call it) thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen weeks and three-dayes after the pretended theft was committed. You do no leſſe when you uſe theſe words (<hi>pag.</hi> 5. <hi>lin</hi> 30.) <hi>Mr.</hi> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens, <hi>now I have finiſhed my</hi> Hu-an-cry, <hi>and it hath been ſo ſerviceable, that you are catched with the words which you ſtole out of the pocket of that Text,</hi> Act. 2.38. Sir, this is a hard charge if you could prove it. But to clear my ſelf of this imputation, I will prove, that in a federall ſenſe, Children may be ſaid to repent and Covenant in their Parents.</p>
               <p>To begin with the example of the Children mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. becauſe this is a plain and pregnant place, I will draw it out more at length for your better information. In theſe words note firſt a Covenant; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the motives, thirdly the Covenanters, or the perſons that did Covenant.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:117779:25"/>
               <p>For the Covenant, it is this, that the people ſhould chuſe the Lord to be their God, and that they ſhould not turn from him to ſerve the gods of the nations. And the Lord on his part did Covenant to chooſe the people for his people, to performe the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> verſ. 9.12, 13, 17, 18. This was the ſubſtance of the Covenant. Secondly, the motives to move them to Covenant, becauſe the Lord had delivered them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with great ſignes and temptations, he had led them through the Wilderneſſe fourty years, their clothes waxed not old upon them, nor the ſhoe waxed old upon their feet. Beſides, he had fed them in an extraordinary manner, he had given them drink out of the Rock, and had delivered them out of the hands of mighty Kings. Theſe were the arguments to induce them to Covenant. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, (to come to the point we are upon) let us conſider the perſons who they were that were Covenanters, and they are expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>Ye ſtand all of you this day before the Lord your God, your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of your Tribes, your Elders, your officers, with all the men of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>[your little ones,] and your wives, and the ſtranger that is in thy Camp, from the hewer of thy wood to the drawer of thy water: That thou ſhouldeſt enter into Covenant with the Lord thy God.</hi> verſ. 10.11, 12. From theſe words you may gather, that Children may Covenant, and that together with their Parents the Lord may look upon them as Covenanters. If this be ſo, pray tell me of what value your argument is, when you ſay, <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be baptized every one of you)</hi> cannot be ſpoken to Father and Child. You bind upon this, that Children cannot repent, <hi>becauſe they have not the firſt principle of profeſſion,</hi> (pag. 3. lin 32.) Now pray, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> tell me plainly and ſincerely, what do you think of the little ones expreſſed in the Text? Were they not Covenanters? Had they not the firſt principle of profeſſion? If that be true which you ſay, that <hi>little ones</hi> have not that firſt principle, that they cannot profeſſe; Why did they then ſtand before the Lord, before the Arke of the Teſtimony, with the moſt publick and repreſentative perſons, with the Elders of the Tribes to enter into Covenant? If you ſhall alledge, that this is an inſtance out of the Old Teſtament, and then was the Church ſtate of the Jews: I do confeſſe as much; but this doth not void the force of the reaſon. For when you ſay that Children cannot Covenant, that they have not the firſt principle of profeſſion, you do not reaſon only againſt the particular Children of this or that diſpenſation, but againſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of any diſpenſation. Therefore I ſay on the contrary, if the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Beleevers in the Jewiſh Church ſtate may be ſaid to Covenant, there is nothing doth exclude but that Beleevers children in theſe laſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117779:26"/>times may be ſaid to profeſſe, repent, Covenant, and come into the Church together with their Parents.</p>
               <p>Further, let us look into the reaſon wherefore in that diſpenſation the Lord did ſo ſtrictly and univerſally call upon all ſorts to enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The reaſon is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Leſt there ſhould be among you any man, or woman, or familie, or tribe, whoſe heart turneth this day away from the Lord our God, to go and ſerve other gods of theſe nations: leſt there ſhould be among you a root that beareth wormwood or gall.</hi> verſ. 18. The Lord did ſo ſtrictly cal upon all, yea upon <hi>little ones,</hi> to enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they and their Parents together, that there ſhould not be a branch or a root among them that might depart from the Lord. Now Sir, do you think that it was to no purpoſe to engage the children, becauſe they had not (as you ſay) the firſt principle of profeſſion? Do you think that in proceſſe of time theſe children might lawfully go after other gods without breach of Covenant, and then plead what you alledge; to wit, that in their minority they could not bind themſelves, they had not the firſt principle of profeſſion? But to come to our own times; there are (as you know) many Chriſtian men carried priſoners into <hi>Turkie,</hi> and when they are there, they are ſtrongly urged to deny the Faith, and to turne <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> In this caſe they dare not yeeld for fear of the breach of Covenant, for fear of violating their promiſe made to the Lord Chriſt in their Baptiſme. In this exigency, Sir, I do deſire to put the queſtion to you, whether this may be ſaid to be breach of Covenant, yea or no? I do it the rather, becauſe in the Poſtſcript of your Anſwer, you jeer at Mr. <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> for ſaying, <hi>that witches after convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſay that the Devil perſwaded them to deny their firſt Baptiſme.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sir, I do put it upon you to anſwer whether this be breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yea or no. If that be true which you ſay, that Infants can make no Covenant, they can break no Covenant. And therefore though it it be evil otherwiſe to deny Chriſt, and to turne Turk, to deny Chriſt and enter into confederacy with the Devil, with you it can be no breach of Covenant, in Baptiſme at leaſt. For where no Covenant was ever made, no Covenant can be broken. If Infants cannot Covenant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in Infancie, there is no reaſon to tye them to that, where they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ability to engage.</p>
               <p>But yet further to let it appear that children may Covenant in their Parents, or (if you will have it) that father and child may Covenant together, conſider the practiſe of the Jewiſh Church in the dayes of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſophat.</hi> When the children of <hi>Moab</hi> and the children of <hi>Ammon</hi> came againſt them to battel, <hi>all Judah ſtood before the Lord, with their [little
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117779:26"/>ones,] their wives and their children.</hi> 2 Chro. 20.13. If any ſhall ask, why did the <hi>little ones</hi> ſtand before the Lord if it be true as you ſay, that they had not the firſt principle of profeſſion? The reaſon is clear, the people of the Jews in thoſe times having no ſtrength of their own to deal againſt ſuch a multitude, they came to humble themſelves and to pray for help, by vertue of the Covenant and the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. This is the reaſon wherefore the Beleevers in that diſpenſation ſtood before the Lord, they and their <hi>little ones.</hi> It was to this end that he might ſee not only Covenanting Parents, but alſo chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Covenant with him: and that both together might implore help by vertue of the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed. Theſe and many other examples might be brought to prove that children may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, profeſſe, Covenant in their Parents that do undertake for them and with them. But leaſt you might plead that theſe are extraordinary caſes, I will make it appear in all times of the Jewiſh Church ſtate, for two thouſand years together, from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren did uſually profeſſe and covenant in their Parents that did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for them. This is true in the naturall Jew, but it is more clear in the <hi>Proſelyte</hi> and his children.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Proſelyte</hi> came in himſelf, he could not be admitted unleſſe he did actually repent, and actually profeſſe Faith in the promiſe, in the time of that diſpenſation. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 6.32, 33. <hi>Ruth.</hi> 1.16. You will ſay then, why were the children admitted, ſeeing they had not (to uſe your words) the firſt principle of profeſſion? It is clear that the children did profeſſe in the Parents that did undertake for them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.38. If this be true in the <hi>Proſelyte</hi> and his children, in all times of the Jewiſh Church, why ſhould not we judge the like of the children of ſuch as were converted from Gentiliſme or Judaiſme, in thoſe firſt times of the Chriſtian Church? Why Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> ſhould it be a thing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible with you, when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Repent and be baptized?</hi> why ſhould it be ſo ſtrange a thing to ſay the children did repent and beleeve in their parents that did undertake for them or with them?</p>
               <p>Now that it may more clearly appear, I will further prove it, that children may repent and profeſſe in their Parents. I will clear it from the Text it ſelf: for when <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted his hearers to repent, the ſinne they ſhould repent of was their crucifying the Lord of life. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the nation of the Jews by crucifying of Chriſt, and by rejecting of the Goſpel, as by this act of the Parents the children were caſt off; So when it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to open their eyes to ſee that ſinne, to mourne over it, then the children ſhall come in, and together with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117779:27"/>their Parents ſhall repent of that national ſinne of crucifying the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> For proof of this let that Text be conſidered, <hi>I will pouer upon the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and the inhabitants of</hi> Hieruſalem, <hi>the ſpirit of grace and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced. In that day there ſhall be a great mourning in</hi> Hieruſalem, <hi>as the mourning of</hi> Hada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimmon <hi>in the valley of</hi> Megiddon. <hi>And the land ſhall mourne, every familie apart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10, 11, 12. This Scripture is to be applyed to the call of the Jews; for the Prophet ſpeaketh of the Spirit of grace that ſhall be poured upon that people in the latter times, and when the whole nation ſhould look to him whom they have peirced, and ſhould mourn for it. But the queſtion is, when that nation ſhall be called to repent of their ſinne in the laſt times, under the Goſpel Church-State? Shall not the children be ſaid nationally to repent in and with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? If you ſhall deny it, then ſhow me, Firſt how the body of the nation may be brought to the Faith? Secondly, how will you ſalve the words of the Prophet which ſaith plainly, <hi>every familie ſhall mourn apart, and their wives apart?</hi> If they ſhall mourn family by family, the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhall be of fathers that ſee their ſinne with their children. Thirdly, If the children have been caſt away many hundred years for their parents ſin, and with their parents, ſhall we not think at the time of their call, that the children ſhall repent of this ſinne, and come in at the time of the comming in of the whole nation? If this be true at the general call of the Jews, (as I think you cannot well deny) then it muſt be true alſo in thoſe that did repent at the hearing of <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon. For the three thouſand that did then beleeve, repent, and come into the Church, were but a pattern of that future call of the Jews that ſhall be in the latter times. And therefore if it be true in the general converſion of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the parents repent and mourn for their ſin of crucifying the <hi>Christ,</hi> that the children may be ſaid to repent in their Parents; I do not ſee but it may be ſome way true alſo in the partiall converſion at <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Sermon. When the parents did mourn for their ſinne of crucifying the Lord of glory, we can judge no other in a Covenant ſenſe, but that the children did mourn in them and with them. And therefore for the three thouſand that were added to the Church, the whole company of ſouls that were baptized, they were no other but beleeving parents and their children. But if you ſhall reply, that there were no children in that company; becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>that they who gladly received the word were baptized.</hi> verſ. 41. I anſwer as before, though the children could not gladly receive the word in their own perſons, yet they might gladly receive it in the perſons of them that did undertake for them. In a ſtrict
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117779:27"/>ſenſe, <hi>little children</hi> cannot be ſaid to come to Chriſt; yet our Saviour doth expound it as though they came themſelves when they were brought in the armes of others. Why elſe ſhould he ſay, <hi>ſuffer little children (to come to me) and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdome of Heaven?</hi> Mat. 19 13. There were ſeventy ſouls that came with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt:</hi> What did they all come in perſon? were there no children in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? The text is plain, <hi>Every man came with his houſhold. Exod.</hi> 1.1. Even ſo among the three thouſand that did gladly receive the word, there might be many children in the company, becauſe the Parents (as then the manner was) might embrace the Goſpel with their houſholds. But that there were children in that company, together with the beleeving Parents, I am moved ſo to judge from theſe reaſons.</p>

                  <item>Secondly, The motive to receive Baptiſme, <hi>(for the promiſe is to you and your children)</hi> ſheweth that the promiſe doth hold to beleevers and their children in the laſt aſwell as in the two former exhibitions: how elſe could it be the ground to baptize?</item>

Would he not receive beleeving parents and their children into Church fellowſhip in the time of the laſt diſpenſation, after that manner as they were received in the time of the adminiſtration going before?</item>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:117779:28"/>
                  <item>Sixthly, In the ſmall portion of the ſtory of the Apoſtles now extant, it is again and again repeated, that ſuch a one received the promiſe of the Chriſt, and was baptized, he and his houſhold. This moveth me to think that the three thouſand ſoules that were baptized and added to the Church, were beleevers and their children.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Everard,</hi> Let it only ſtand as probable, whether or no there were children in that company. This is that which I affirm from <hi>Peters</hi> words, that the children of beleevers have a right to Baptiſme, both by the word of Promiſe, and the word of Command. And for your objection, that the children cannot repent, that they have not the firſt principle of profeſſion, I have ſhewed many examples that in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſenſe they may be ſaid to repent and to profeſſe in their beleeving parents. It is my judgment, if beleevers and their children be baptized, they muſt before Baptiſme make profeſſion of repentance. But how? The parents in their own perſons, and the children vertually and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively in the parents that do undertake for them. Now, Sir, I leave it to your own conſcience, and to all the world beſide, to judge what reaſon you had ſo to accuſe me of tearing the words of <hi>Peter</hi> aſunder, the words <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> from the words <hi>repent and</hi>—. You might have ſpared your accuſations of felonie, your inſtances of mangling the words of <hi>David, The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God.</hi> Pſal. 14.1. and ſuch like Scriptures. You might have ſpared your Rhetoricall amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; for I do hold that the children in a Covenant ſenſe did repent and profeſſe in their parents. In ſaying, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> Father and Child, I have not torne the ſentence, neither have I taken the words that come after, from the words going before, <hi>repent and— &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, Sir, having freed my ſelf of that falſe and untrue imputation, I come to turne that which you have ſaid upon your own head. Seeing you are ſo apt to accuſe, I would intreat you ſeriouſly to conſider that which our Saviour ſpake ſometime to the Phariſees, when they asked him <hi>why do thy Diſciples tranſgreſſe the tradition of the Elders, for they waſh not their hands when they eat bread;</hi> His anſwer was, <hi>why do you tranſgreſſe the Commandement of God through your traditions? Mat.</hi> 15.2, 3, 4, 5. In like manner when you condemne me for tearing aſunder letters and ſyllables and ſuch like trifles, I may truly reply; why do you tear aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Promiſe from the Command, and the Command from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God; and ſpoyle the Scope, Union, and neceſſary dependance of <hi>Peters</hi> words? God hath ſaid to Beleevers in the laſt and beſt exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition ot the Covenant, <hi>the promiſe is to you and your children:</hi> And for their greater encouragement he doth exhort them, Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:117779:28"/>to be baptized in relation to the ſame promiſe, Now you (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne your own language home again) do clip, cut, and pluck the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Beleevers <hi>as it were by the ears</hi> out of the word of Command, when they are plainly and expreſſely mentioned in the word of Promiſe: And ſo by conſequence in matter of Baptiſme, you make Gods word of Promiſe and Command of none effect through your traditions. You are further pleaſed to liken me to a <hi>theeviſh Gleaner that draggeth out the corn by the ears,</hi> and looſeth the band of the ſheaf, (<hi>pag.</hi> 4. <hi>lin.</hi> 17.) Sir, if I have done (as you ſay) with the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> if I have torne the foregoing from the following words, then let me bear the blame with all pious men. But I hope I have ſaid enough to purge my ſelf of that crime; and if need ſhall ſo require, much more may be ſaid to the ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of any reaſonable man. On the contrary, If every man had his own right, the ſimilitude doth more fitly appertain to you, and to ſuch as you are. For if any man ſhall put the queſtion to me; <hi>How do you prove out of the words of</hi> Peter <hi>that beleevers children ought to he baptized?</hi> I will anſwer, the children ought to be baptized, becauſe theſe words <hi>for the promiſe is to you and your children,</hi> do immediately follow the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> and are annexed as the ground of the precept. If he ſhall ſay, how do you prove that? I will reply, I prove it from the union of the Apoſtles words, and eſpecially from the word <hi>(For)</hi> which as a band doth unite and couple the two parts of the Text together. He exhorteth them firſt, <hi>be baptized every one of you;</hi> and then uſeth this motive, <hi>for the promiſe is to you and your children.</hi> Now on the other ſide, if your aſſertion be true, that the words <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> cannot be ſpoken to Father and Child; how will this anſwer to the motive, <hi>For the promiſe is to you and your children?</hi> And what will become of the word <hi>(For),</hi> the band or the connexive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, that knits the parts of the ſentence together? Sir, By this time you may underſtand who the man is that may be likned to a <hi>theeviſh Gleaner,</hi> that doth dragge out S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peters</hi> words by the eares, and doth ſpoile the union of the ſentence. I will conclude with your own words, (pag. 5. <hi>lin.</hi> 22) Sir, <hi>I deſire you to take heed that place do not fall upon your head,</hi> Rev. 22.18. <hi>for I teſtify unto every man that heareth the words of the Prophecy of this book, If any man ſhall take away from the words of the book of this Prophecie, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of Life, and out of the holy City, and from the things which are written in this book.</hi> I come now briefly to your other particulars.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You ſay that theſe words, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> were ſpoken to the ſame <hi>You</hi> which the Apoſtle directed his ſpeech unto,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117779:29"/>and you never read of any Command given to Infants; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.2. (<hi>pag.</hi> 6. <hi>lin.</hi> 15.) I anſwer, theſe words were mediatly, and ſecondarily ſpoken to the children, though they were primarily and immediatly directed to the Parents that did engage for them. In the inſtitution of circumciſion, the Lord ſaith, <hi>This is my Covenant which you ſhall keep betwixt me and you, and thy ſeed after thee; every manchild among you ſhall be circumciſed, and ye ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin, and it ſhall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you. And the uncircumciſed manchild, whoſe fleſh of his foreskin is not circumciſed, he ſhall be cut off from his people, he hath broken my Covenant.</hi> Gen. 17.10, 11, 14. Here in theſe words the Command is principally and explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to the Parents; yet ſo as it is ſecondarily and incluſively ſpoken to the children that do enter into Covenant, either in or with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. If this be not a truth, how can it be ſaid, <hi>the uncircumciſed man-child ſhall be cut off from his people, he hath broken my Covenant?</hi> If he may be cut off from his people for breach of Covenant, he may be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Covenant, and the Lord may look upon him in the notion of a Covenanter. Whereas you ſay, <hi>you never read of any Command given to Infants, but on the contrary,</hi> Deut. 11.2. I pray you let us read the Text, <hi>And I know you this day; for I ſpeak not with your children which have not known, and which have not ſeen the chaſtiſement of the Lord your God, his greatneſſe, his mighty hand, and his ſtretched out arme, and his miracles, and his acts which he did in the midſt of</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here I demand, ſhall we abſolutely conclude, that God did not ſpeak at all to the children of theſe parents who only were eye-witneſſes of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles done in <hi>Egypt?</hi> Surely then we muſt conclude, that all the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>Moſes</hi> his law, did concerne the Parents only that were then alive, and not the children in after generations. Doth not this gloſſe croſſe the whole ſcope of Scripture? Do we not read everywhere that the Parents were to teach their children, and that the children were to remember the wonders and miracles which the Lord had done in <hi>Egypt?</hi> For the Text, the ſcope of it is this, <hi>Moſes</hi> doth more ſpecially exhort them that were alive to love the Lord their God, to keep his charge and his ſtatutes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. becauſe their eyes had ſeen all the great acts which he had done. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. Now, Sir, Whereas it is ſaid that the Lord did not ſpeak to the children, you cannot conclude this abſolutely, that he did not ſpeak to them at all, but only reſpectively, in that particular ſenſe. Now, what is this but a fallacy as Logicians terme it, <hi>à dicto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter?</hi> But ſuppoſing that theſe words could not be ſpoken to the children, you go on and enquire whether they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117779:29"/>were ſpoken to the Apoſtles: when you ſay to me (<hi>pag.</hi> 6. <hi>lin.</hi> 23.) <hi>But happily you conceive that in theſe words a Commiſſion was given to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to baptize Father and Child; but (be baptized every one of you) cannot help you there neither: For if theſe had been words ſpoken to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, then the Apoſtles had been commanded to repent and be baptized.</hi> Such a dexterity you have to make difficulties where none be. Therefore to the clearing of this matter from this miſt which you would purpoſely caſt over it, you are to note, in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme there is the adminiſtrator, and the perſon baptizing; and there is the ſubject and perſon baptized. Now I ſay the Command doth extend to both, it doth extend to the Adminiſtrator to miniſter Baptiſme from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Chriſt; and it doth appertain to Beleevers to receive Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, they and the children under their education when they come to profeſſe the <hi>Christ</hi> come in the fleſh. In caſe the Parents neglect the bringing of their children to Baptiſme, they do in ſenſe omit the publick profeſſion of the Faith, a conſiderable part of which is to engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and thoſe that live under their education to the Lord <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But now to the third point.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You ſay it is a great miſtake to judge theſe Jews to whom <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake to be Beleevers; they are your own words. <hi>If there were no beleeving Parents, there could be no Beleevers Infants.</hi> Sir, I do agree with you that the Conſequence is good; but that theſe men who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted by the Apoſtle to be baptized, they and their children, that they were not looked upon by him in the notion of Beleevers before Baptiſme, this I deny. Indeed according to the uſuall method of your partie (whoſe cheif deſigne is to make the people) you bring in two or three ſimple reaſons of your own to prove them Beleevers, and patch them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my back as if I were the author of them.</p>
               <p>But firſt, I do not ſay becauſe the Promiſe did belong to them, that therefore they were Beleevers, for then all the ſeed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would be Beleevers of the laſt diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Neither do I ſay, becauſe they were cut to the heart, and had the ſpirit of bondage, that therefore they were Beleevers: for to ſpeak truly, a Beleever doth make ſpeciall application of the general promiſe; but the ſpirit of bondage doth ariſe from the particular aſſent to the general threats. Yet nevertheleſſe in the particularity of the ſin from whence the ſpirit of bondage doth ariſe, I ſhould (for my part) be more warie then abſolutely to conclude, that theſe men as ſuch were unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. To me it is a ſtrange thing, that a man ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the heart for crucifying the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>leeve him to be the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:117779:30"/>There are ſome other ſtrange paſſages of yours concerning the ſpirit of bondage, and concerning the meaning of <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.8. which ſhow you to be very rude and unexpert in the true ſenſe of the Scriptures: <hi>When the ſpirit ſaith, but the fearfull, and the unbeleeving, and the abominable, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and whoremongers, &amp;c.</hi> Would any man beſides your ſelf expound the <hi>(Fearfull)</hi> to be meant of all thoſe that lie under the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, that all ſuch ſhould have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone? By this reaſon you muſt needs condemne many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſoules, and put them under a heavy condition. But, Sir, that you may not be deceived, the word <hi>(Fearfull) muſt be expounded</hi> according to the Analogie of the whole Prophecie, which is concerning the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Saints under the Antichriſtian ſtate. The word <hi>(Fearfull)</hi> then is to be applied to them that deny Chriſt in the time of perſecution for fear of man. How croſſely then do you apply it to them that are under the ſpirit of bondage through fear of the juſtice of God? But in this caſe you do no better with this Scripture, then many others do with the raign of Chriſt upon the Earth. They take it, that the glory of his Kingdome doth lie in plucking down of Magiſtracy and Miniſtery, and laying all things level; whereas if they did rightly underſtand the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the ſcope of the Prophecy, they would find that the Lord Chriſt doth begin to raigne when a godly Magiſtracy is ſet up in the Common-wealth, and a powerfull Miniſtery (aſſigned to preach the Goſpel by vertue of office) is ſeated in the Church; But this by the way. Now, Sir, that <hi>Peters</hi> hearers were true Beleevers, of the laſt diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I am moved to beleeve it from this double ground.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the tender of the Promiſe. The Promiſe was not only offered to them as it was revealed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and beleeved in all the times of the Jewiſh Church, to wit, that the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come; but the promiſe tendered to them, was remiſſion of ſinne by the blood of the particular <hi>Jeſus</hi> already come, whom they had crucified and ſlaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I take them to be Beleevers from the receiving of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: For as remiſſion of ſinne was tendered to them by the blood of the particular <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So when they on their part did receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo exhibited, they were Beleevers. And in this ſenſe, I ſay, the word of Command was that they and the children under their education ſhould be baptized.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, (<hi>pag.</hi> 9. <hi>lin.</hi>) 32. You come to the main point; to wit, that a right to the Promiſe doth not inferre and bring in a right to Baptiſme. You argue thus, <hi>If</hi> Peter <hi>had a Commiſſion ſo large, to baptize all to whom
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117779:30"/>the Promiſe did belong, then he muſt have baptized the whole nation of the Jewes, and particularly the perſons to whom he ſpake before the word came unto them, or before their Conſcience was awakened by the word.</hi> Here, Sir, I do acknowledge that you ſpeak punctually to the aſſumption in my argument. Therefore for the more clear illuſtration of the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> and for the more full diſcovery of the force of the argument which I have alledged, I will ſtay the longer upon this point.</p>
               <p>And to begin with the ground of all, I do not ſay (though you are willing to miſtake my meaning) that a right to the Promiſe doth abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inferre a right to Baptiſme: for then all beleevers from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world would have had a right to Baptiſme. But I ſay this, that the right which Beleevers and their children have to the Promiſe (as exhibited, revealed, and declared in the laſt times under the New Teſtament,) this doth inferre and bring in a right to Baptiſme. And in this doth the force of my argument conſiſt.</p>
               <p>That this may more evidently be declared, and that you may judge aright, I would intreat you to diſtinguiſh between the Promiſe it ſelf, and the ſeverall revelations, exhibitions, manifeſtations, and editions of the ſame Promiſe. The Ocean ſea is one and the ſame, but yet as it beats upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> coaſt, it is called the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſea; as it beats upon the <hi>French</hi> coaſt, it is called the <hi>French</hi> ſea; and upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coaſt, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſea: So the Promiſe is one and the ſame to Beleevers and their children; yet according to ſeveral diſpenſations it is various &amp; manifold.</p>
               <p>To begin therefore with the Promiſe it ſelf. There is but one way of ſalvation, by <hi>Chriſt</hi> the promiſed Seed, according to that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. But for the degrees of revelation, there are three remarkable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions and editions of the Promiſe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The firſt is, for the ſpace of two thouſand years, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The ſecond is, for the ſpace of two thouſand years, from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The third is, from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the end of the world.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe ſeverall exhibitions of the Promiſe ought carefully to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: for from hence do ariſe the differences of Faith, the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of profeſſion of the Faith, the difference of Church ſtates, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the ſeals of admiſſion, the differences of right to the ſeals of admiſſion. Yea the differences are ſo great, that a true beleever of the heart under one diſpenſation cannot have a right, as ſuch, to the Church ſtate, or the ſeal of admiſſion under another diſpenſation. I ſay, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117779:31"/>not have a right to the Church ſtate, or the ſeal of admiſſion, till he hath received the Promiſe as exhibited and revealed under that particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. Yet nevertheleſſe, let there be never ſuch great diverſitie, this will ſtill prove a firme and an undoubted truth in all exhibitions and diſpenſations, that when a man beleeveth the Promiſe, and doth come in, the right to Church-memberſhip ſhall belong to him and to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Let us now come to inſtance.</p>
               <p>The firſt edition of the Promiſe is for two thouſand years from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and here though God did not ſhow the ſonnes of men the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in perſon as he doth to us, nor of what particular familie or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſhould come, as he did to the people of the Jewes; yet in the general he did make ſo much of the truth thereof known to them, <hi>that the Seed of the woman ſhould break the Serpents head.</hi> Gen. 3.15. He did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to beleeve the promiſe ſo generally revealed, and to make publick profeſſion thereof: and to ſuch as did beleeve and publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, the priviledge did belong to them to be called the people of God; and in thoſe times the promiſe was to beleevers and their naturall ſeed. For proof of this, let us conſider that Scripture; <hi>The ſonnes of God ſaw the daughters of men were faire.</hi> Gen. 6.2. By <hi>ſons of God</hi> you are not to underſtand them in that ſenſe as they are meant <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. There it is ſaid, <hi>If ye be led by the ſpirit of God, then ye are the ſons of God.</hi> The ſons of God in the Text of <hi>Geneſis</hi> cannot be taken in this ſenſe that they had the Spirit of God, and were led by his Spirit; but they are called the ſons of God, becauſe they were the naturall poſterity of beleeving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, becauſe they were the children of <hi>Seth,</hi> and other holy men, who in thoſe times are mentioned to call upon the name of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.26. This ſheweth plainly in the time of the firſt exhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the promiſe, that Beleevers children, as ſuch, had a right to Church-memberſhip with their Parents; and I may ſay alſo to the ſeal of admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if any ſuch had been in thoſe firſt times.</p>
               <p>The ſecond edition of the Promiſe is for two thouſand years from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And here though the Lord did not go ſo far with them as to ſhow the promiſed Seed in perſon, as he hath done to us: yet he went further with them then with the Beleeevers of the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. He did not only ſhow them the bleſſed Seed to come, but the particular familie and nation from whence he ſhould come. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that did beleeve under this diſpenſation, were not only bound to beleeve the general promiſe made to <hi>Adam</hi> concerning the loſt ſonnes of men; but they were to beleeve the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham;</hi> they were more particularly bound to joyn themſelves to that familie, and to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117779:31"/>make publick profeſſion of the Promiſe, as revealed in the time of that exhibition. They that did this, the promiſe did belong to them and to their children, and ſo conſequently the children had a right to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church that then was, by the initiall ſeal, or by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion the ſeal of admittance.</p>
               <p>Now the third edition of the Promiſe is from <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto the end of the world. And here the Lord doth not only ſhow the general promiſe made to the loſt ſons of men, nor the promiſed Seed to come of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular familie of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but he goeth further to ſhow the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> individually, and in perſon, who he is. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, conceived by the holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>ſuffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is the promiſed Seed. They therefore that beleeve under this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, they are not only bound to receive the Promiſe as generally made in the two former diſpenſations; but they are further required (as may appear by the Apoſtles Sermons) to beleeve the <hi>Chriſt</hi> come in the fleſh, and that he is the promiſed Seed. Now they that do receive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as exhibited in this manner, have a right to Baptiſme, the ſeal of admiſſion into the Church in the times of the New Teſtament. And not only ſo, but as to beleevers in the two former diſpenſations, ſo in this laſt and beſt exhibition of the Covenant, the Promiſe doth hold one and the ſame in ſubſtance to Beleevers and their Children. This is the true ſenſe of <hi>Peters</hi> words, and this is the force of my argument.</p>
               <p>Having thus laid down the ſeveral exhibitions of the Promiſe, and how in each exhibition the Promiſe variouſly diſpenſed, is the ground of Faith, Faith the ground of Profeſſion, Profeſſion the ground from whence Beleevers in any diſpenſation have a right to Church member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſo conſequently to the ſeal of admiſſion in each diſpenſation reſpectively; Having laid down theſe grounds, I come now to anſwer your objections.</p>
               <p>You ſay (pag. 9. lin. 32.) <hi>If the Commiſſion be ſo large to baptize all to Whom the Promiſe doth appertain, why doth the Apoſtle lay ſuch a preciſe ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k upon them to repent before they could be baptized? Seeing the Promiſe did belong to the Nation of the Iewes,</hi> Rom. 9. <hi>Why did not the Apoſtle ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize the whole Nation? Why did he not baptize theſe particular Iewes that had crucified Chriſt before they were awakened by the word? Why did not hee his endeavour to baptize them againſt their wills, and to take them napping while they were aſleep, as you do with your Infants in</hi> England? Sir, this is the ſubſtance of your cavils. To all which I anſwer, thoſe priviledges mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. to wit, <hi>The Covenants, the giving of the Law, the ſervice of God and the promiſes,</hi> all theſe priviledges dib be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117779:32"/>to the Jews, not as they were a Nation, but as they were a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting Nation.</p>
               <p>For you may find by the ſcope of the Scripture, that theſe things did not only belong to the naturall Jews, but alſo to the Proſelytes and their children, as well as to them <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When you have all done, the naturall Jews were but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and ſo capable of the ſeal of admiſſion in their own particular diſpenſation. Nay, for the moſt part, theſe Jewes that looked for the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that had the promiſe and the ſeal of the promiſe in their own diſpenſation, formerly they were, and as yet are, the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers of the particular <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the greateſt enemies of the promiſe, as exhibited and revealed in the laſt times. For this very cauſe <hi>Peter</hi> did bring the word ſo ſharply home to the conſcience to awaken them, ſeeing they could not poſſibly receive the promiſe in the laſt exhibition, who had been before the crucifiers of the particular <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Whereas you ſay. <hi>That the Apoſtle might have baptized them againſt their wills, and have taken them napping as we do with our Infants in</hi> England;</p>
               <p>Sir, Your compariſon will not hold, for the Infants of this Church, though they have no actuall underſtanding, yet they are the children of ſuch as do beleeve, at leaſt ſuch as profeſſe they do beleeve the particular <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They do not only beleeve the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that he ſhould come of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as did the Beleevers of the Jewiſh Church; but they beleeve, at leaſt they profeſſe they beleeve the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which the Jewiſh Nation had crucified and ſlaine. Further they profeſſe that they will bring up their Infants, at leaſt they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that their Infants ſhould be taught by the publick Miniſtery under which they live by and through it to be brought up in the Chriſtian Faith, and ſo to look after the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For this reaſon Sir, your compariſon will not hold betwixt the Infants of this Nation, and the Jews that were the crucifiers of the Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Further, you go on and reaſon (<hi>pag.</hi> 10. <hi>lin.</hi> 17.) <hi>If the promiſe did belong to the Jews and their children, why did not the Prophets baptize? this is to call the Prophets accurſed for the neglect of the dutie that appertained to them.</hi> To which I anſwer, I ſhould have called the Prophets accurſed if they had neglected to call upon the people to beleeve the promiſe, and to apply the ſeal of the promiſe to themſelves and to their children, ſo far as it did appertain to their own diſpenſation. But I think that no ſober man will ſay, it was the dutie of the Prophets to call upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to beleeve the promiſe, and to receive the ſeal of the promiſe, in ſuch and ſuch a particular diſpenſation, before the promiſe as ſuch came
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117779:32"/>to be revealed to them. But to come a little more cloſely to you, though the Prophets were righteous men, and ſaved by Chriſt to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.39, 40. Yet God never required them to go any further but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Promiſe only; and to receive the ſeal as exhibited and revealed in their own diſpenſation. The words of the Apoſtle are clear and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to this purpoſe, <hi>Of which ſalvation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Prophets have enquired and ſearched diligently, who prophecied of the grace that ſhould come unto you. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom it was revealed, not unto themſelves, but unto us they did miniſter this grace.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.10, 11.</p>
               <p>Nay further, to come to the times of the manifeſtation of Chriſt in the fleſh; I ſay then, the true beleevers of the two former diſpenſations, who might have been ſaved by their faith in their own diſpenſation; I ſay, theſe very beleevers themſelves could not be baptized till they had received the promiſe as ſet forth in the laſt times. To come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examples; we read when the Eunuch demanded of <hi>Philip, Here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? Philip</hi> ſaid, <hi>if thou beleeveſt withall thine heart thou mayeſt.</hi> Act. 8.36, 37. From theſe words ſome gather that not a Diſciple of the doctrine, but a Diſciple in a more ſtrict ſenſe, a true beleever of the heart, is the only ſubject of Baptiſme. Now for the clearing of this point, I ask, did not the Eunuch beleeve before the preaching of <hi>Philip?</hi> If he were not a Proſelyte, how could a man of his employment be ſaid to come from ſo remote a country to worſhip at <hi>Hieruſalem?</hi> Therefore it muſt needs be preſumed, that he was a true Beleever of the ſecond diſpenſation. But you will ſay, what doth <hi>Philip</hi> mean when he uſeth theſe words. <hi>If thou beleeveſt thou mayeſt?</hi> The ſcope of <hi>Philip</hi> was not only to ſhow the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and individually to declare the <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the laſt exhibition of the promiſe: <hi>Then</hi> Philip <hi>opened his mouth, and began at that Scripture, and preached to him Jeſus.</hi> verſ. 36. Hereupon the Eunuch beleeving, not only a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come, but alſo that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was that particular <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and profeſſing to beleeve this with all his heart, he was baptized imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly: And if he had twenty children there preſent, they had been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the ſeal of Baptiſme, Father and Child together. To make this more clear, we will go to the example of <hi>Lydia;</hi> Of her it is ſaid, <hi>that the Lord opened her heart, Act.</hi> 10.14. I ask then, was that the firſt time of opening the hear of <hi>Lydia?</hi> No, ſhe was a worſhipper of God before: The words of the text are plain, Lydia <hi>a ſeller of purple, of the City of</hi> Thyatira <hi>which worſhipped God, heard us.</hi> She could not worſhip God, but ſhe muſt ſome way or other beleeve his Promiſe, either in the firſt or the ſecond exhibition thereof. You will ſay then, what is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117779:33"/>the meaning of the words, <hi>The Lord opened her heart?</hi> The meaning is this, the Lord opened her heart to receive the promiſe in the third exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, to beleeve the particular <hi>Chriſt</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> preached: And when ſhe had done this, ſhe was baptized immediatly. Now that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you that the promiſe doth appertain to Beleevers and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the laſt, as in the two former diſpenſations, ſhe and all her houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold were baptized together.</p>
               <p>Further, what ſhould be the reaſon, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay to the <hi>Gaoler beleeve in the Lord, and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thine houſe,</hi> Acts 16.31? Why doth he ſpeak of the ſalvation of the houſe upon the termes of the <hi>Gaolers</hi> beleeving; but that the promiſe doth hold to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers and their children in the laſt exhibition thereof? But if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, That the Apoſtle ſpake the word of the Lord to all that were in the <hi>Gaolers</hi> houſe; <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. He did ſo; but how doth this prove that they had true faith wrought in their hearts? They were all Pagans and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels over-night, and the bare preaching of the word doth not make men beleevers, as we ſee by experience. Therefore we muſt conclude, that the <hi>Gaoler</hi> himſelf only had an inward work, and by a ſpeciall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did receive the <hi>Chriſt</hi> come in the fleſh: hereupon <hi>he and all his,</hi> ſervants and children, as we may expound it, were baptized immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>verſ.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>And thus far, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> I have gone in anſwering your ſeverall exceptions. Now, before I ſee how you conclude, it ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe for me to adde two or three parallel Scriptures, for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the expoſition which I have given.</p>
               <p>If you ſtand upon the expreſſion <hi>(every one of you,)</hi> that the children cannot be intended in the Apoſtles words, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> if your doubt doth lie here, you may read ſuch places of Scripture where the command is given to the Parent as to the head of the houſhold, both for himſelf and for his children. Take for example thoſe words in the inſtitution of the paſſeover, <hi>ſpeak unto all the Congregation of Iſrael, that they take every man a Lamb, according to the houſe of their fathers, a Lamb for an houſe. And if the houſhold be too little for the Lamb, let him and his neighbour, next to his houſe, take it according to the number of ſoules; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man according to his eating ſhall make his accompt for the Lamb.</hi> Exod. 12.3, 4. Here in theſe words the Command is that <hi>(every man)</hi> take a Lamb, that <hi>(every man) according to his eating make his accompt for the Lamb.</hi> By <hi>(every man)</hi> if you argue ſtrictly, is only meant every head of an houſhold; for the nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was divided into Tribes, the Tribes into Families, and the Families into Houſholds; and every
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117779:33"/>Head is here commanded to take a Lamb. Now ſeeing the word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is only to all heads of houſholds, will you ſay that the children and the houſhold are not included? If you will affirme this, it is plain from the ſcope of the Text, though the Command was laid upon the Parent or Head to provide, yet the houſhold were to eat the proviſions of the Paſſeover. So in the like caſe I ſay, though the words <hi>(be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized every one of you)</hi> be ſpoken to the Parents primarily and chiefly, yet the Children are contained in the Command, and the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is given in a federal and Covenant ſenſe for themſelves and for their Children. If you peruſe the ſtorie of the Acts of the Apoſtles, you ſhall find that the truth of this was made good: Such a one did beleeve and profeſſe, and was baptized, he and his houſhold.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If your doubt lie in this, that the Children are not named in ſo many letters and ſyllables in the word of Command; To my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this ſhould ſatisfie, that they are afterward plainly expreſſed in the word of promiſe. It is a uſuall thing in Scripture to ſupply the meaning of the words that go before, by the ſenſe and conſtruction of the words that follow after. Many inſtances might be brought to prove ſuch a ſupply; but I will chooſe one rather which is proper to the caſe of Baptiſme. And ſo you will come to have not only a precept, but alſo a convenient number of examples in the New Teſtament for the Baptiſme of Infants. The place is this, <hi>Crispus the chief ruler of the Synagogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved on the Lord withall his houſe.</hi> And many of <hi>the Corinthians hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beleeved, and were baptized.</hi> Acts 18.8. Now out of theſe words Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> I do deſire to put a double queſtion to your conſideration. The firſt is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether in the ſenſe of this Scripture, was not</hi> Criſpus <hi>and his houſe baptized, aſ well as the reſt of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>that did beleeve?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here if you go to the ſtrictneſſe of the Letter, the other <hi>Corinthians</hi> that did beleeve were only baptized; As for <hi>Criſpus</hi> and his houſhold they are ſaid to beleeve. Criſpus <hi>the chief ruler of the Synagogue beleeved on the Lord with all his houſe.</hi> Here only is mention made of their belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but not the leaſt word of their Baptiſme. What then ſhall we ſay, that they were not baptized at all? He that will affirme this, let him ſhow a reaſon why the other <hi>Corinthians</hi> beleeving ſhould be baptized, and <hi>Criſpus</hi> a prime Beleever, with his houſhold, ſhould be exempt from Baptiſme? Secondly, to put all out of doubt, whoſoever they were of the beleeving <hi>Corinthians</hi> that were baptized, whoſoever the perſons were that did baptize them, it is clear from another place, that <hi>Criſpus</hi> the chief ruler of the Synagogue was baptized with <hi>Pauls</hi> own hand.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:117779:34"/>
                  <hi>I thank God I baptized none of you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) <hi>but</hi> Criſpus <hi>and</hi> Gaius. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. If this be ſo, it is manifeſt that the Text in the <hi>Acts</hi> muſt be read with a ſupply; the latter part muſt expound the meaning of the former. The words muſt needs go after this tenor. Criſpus, <hi>the chief ruler of the Synagogue, beleeved on the Lord with all his houſe and was baptized: and many of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>beleeving were baptized.</hi> Here that which is wanting in the former part of the <hi>verſe</hi> muſt be ſupplied with the ſenſe of that part which commeth after; or elſe how ſhall we reconcile the Scriptures? Now in the like caſe, let us have liberty when we read <hi>(be baptized every one of you)</hi> to ſupply the former with the ſenſe of the words that follow after: and we ſhall have a plain precept from the Baptiſme of Beleevers and their Children. The words muſt runne thus, <hi>Be baptized every one of you and your children; for the Promiſe is to you and your children.</hi> But now, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> ſuppoſing that <hi>Criſpus</hi> and his houſhold were baptized (as you can ſuppoſe no other if you will prove conſtant to your own principles of Beleevers Baptiſme) I ſay then in the ſecond place,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether among the</hi> Corinthians <hi>that did beleeve through grace, was the houſhold of</hi> Criſpus <hi>the only houſhold that was baptized?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we go to the preciſe Letter of the Text, there is only mention made of the houſhold of <hi>Criſpus,</hi> and not any word of the houſhold of any other Beleever in the City of <hi>Corinth</hi> What then ſhall we ſay? That no other Beleevers houſhold was baptized in that City? This cannot be; for though <hi>Criſpus</hi> was a prime Beleever, yet we may well imagine that other houſes of Beleevers had the ſame priviledge. To put the matter out of queſtion, whoſoever they were that did adminiſter Baptiſme to the reſt of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> it is evident that the houſhold of <hi>Stephanas</hi> was baptized with <hi>Pauls</hi> own hand: For he ſpeaking to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> thus ſaith, <hi>I baptized the houſhold of</hi> Stephanas, <hi>and I know not whether I baptized any other.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.16. Therefore to reconcile one Scripture with another, we muſt needs read the forementioned place in the <hi>Acts</hi> after this manner: Criſpus <hi>the chief ruler of the Synagogue beleeved on the Lord, and was baptized, he and his houſhold; and many of the</hi> Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians <hi>hearing beleeved, and were baptized, they and their houſholds.</hi> If this interpretation be true (as I know not how elſe to make the Scriptures to agree) then we have not only one, or two, or three, but many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the New Teſtament for baptizing Beleevers with their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds.</p>
               <p>Further, I may collect alſo, in thoſe times it was a uſuall manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Corinthians</hi> when the Parent did beleeve and profeſſe, it was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:117779:34"/>ordinary for him and his houſhold to be baptized together. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when particular mention is made of the houſhold of <hi>Criſpus,</hi> we are not to take it in that ſenſe as though they were the only beleeving Familie in the Citie of <hi>Corinth;</hi> but the meaning is this; As <hi>Criſpus,</hi> a leading and a prime Beleever, the Ruler of the Synagogue, was baptized, he and his houſhold: So the reſt of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (after the pattern of <hi>Crispus</hi>) beleeving were baptized, they and their houſholds. From whence we gather; That a beleeving houſhold, in the third and laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, is to be taken in that ſenſe and notion as ever before in the two former Adminiſtrations of the Promiſe. In the two former Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for two thouſand years from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and for two thouſand years from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a beleeving houſhold was that where the Parent did profeſſe himſelf, and did engage his Familie to the profeſſion of the Faith. And in this ſenſe muſt we needs take a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving houſhold in the third diſpenſation, when <hi>Criſpus</hi> the Ruler of the Synagogue did beleeve with all his houſhold, and when many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did beleeve with all their houſholds. We are not to take it as though every one did in perſon beleeve and profeſſe; but that they did every one live under the education and inſtruction of the Chriſtian Faith. But if any ſhall urge, that the words of the Text are for actuall profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for actuall faith before Baptiſme, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Many of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>hearing, beleeved and were baptized;</hi> If any ſhall urge, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> only that did hear and beleeve, were baptized: he that ſhall ſo argue, I would intreat him to ſhow me in what place, or in what ranke he will ſet the children of theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> that did beleeve through grace.</p>
               <p>If he will ſay that the Children in their Families were out-caſts of the Covenant, then let him ſhow the meaning of this Scripture, <hi>The unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving huſband is ſanctified by the wife, and the unbeleeving wife is ſanctified by the husband; elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. There muſt needs be a ſenſe aſſigned how the children of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and other <hi>Grecians,</hi> being profane by nature, may be ſaid to be holy by the Parents beleeving. Though much hath been written and ſaid to finde out this or that interpretation; yet for my part I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly find out a ſenſe how the Children of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as born of one or two beleeving Parents, may be ſaid to be holy, if this be not meant of Covenant holyneſſe. In the two former diſpenſations, for four thouſand years together, the children of beleevers were accounted the ſons of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2, 3. The holy Seed, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.2. The holy People, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.24. The Children of the Kingdome, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.11. The
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117779:35"/>Children of the Covenant, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. And ſuch like expreſſions. Therefore when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Children of the beleeving <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that becauſe one or both Parents did beleeve and profeſſe, therefore the Children were holy, I cannot underſtand this any other way, but of the Birth-priviledge of Beleevers Children now in the laſt, aſwell as in the two former editions of the Promiſe. Therefore when it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>that many of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>beleeving were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> I cannot ſee how the words can bear any other ſenſe but this; <hi>Many of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>beleeving were baptized, they and their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds;</hi> as <hi>Criſpus</hi> the chief ruler of the Synagogue beleeved, and was baptized, he and his houſhould. The Analogue doth ſtand between <hi>Criſpus</hi> and other Beleevers, between the houſhold of <hi>Criſpus</hi> and the houſholds of other Beleevers: and this I take to be the true meaning of the Text. I have ſtayed the longer upon this point, to ſhow that we have not only a Precept, but a competent number of examples out of the New Teſtament, for the Baptiſme of Beleevers and their Children. But now Sir, leſt you ſhould take occaſion to cavill at examples, aſwell as at the Precept; I will inſiſt upon the former part of the <hi>verſe,</hi> and urge you only with this queſtion, <hi>Whether do you think that</hi> Criſpus <hi>beleeving on the Lord with all his houſe, was baptized with the reſt of the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>yea or no?</hi> If you deny it, how will you prove conſtant to your own principles of Beleevers Baptiſme? Why ſhould not <hi>Criſpus,</hi> a prime Beleever be baptized aſwell as the reſt of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve through grace? But if you affirme it (as affirm it you muſt) then it is neceſſary (ſeeing his Baptiſme is not expreſſed in ſo many Letters) that you ſupply the former part of the Verſe with the ſenſe of the words that follow after. Now let me do the like with <hi>Peters</hi> words, and you ſhall find an excellent harmonie; <hi>Then</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid, repent and be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed every one of you (and your children), in the name of the Lord Jeſus Christ, for the remiſſion of ſinne; for the Promiſe belongs to you and your children.</hi> So I beleeve the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> and deſight to hear their ſweet agreement; I do delight to read the Children in the word of Command, ſeeing they are ſo plainly expreſſed in the word of Promiſe. Now, Sir, let us ſee how you conclude.</p>
               <p>You bid me, as I tender the life of my argument, to have him to ſome other place for relief; You tell me (<hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>lin.</hi> 1.) <hi>that you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an order from Quarter-Maſter Generall, that the tent of my argument be removed from the Text, that it may no longer cumber the holy ground, it being appointed for a piece of ſervice more honourable.</hi> Surely, Sir, when you wrote theſe things, I cannot otherwiſe think but that you had
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:117779:35"/>ſome high opinion of your own performance, Whereas you adviſe me to have my argument to ſome other place; belike you would have me to underſtand that you had (according to the title of your book) conquered all before you. But I will aſſure you Sir, (to deal plainly with you, and that you may not flatter your ſelf) you are ſo far from taking my chief Fort (as you pretend) that you have not at all, or at leaſt in ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree given an aſſault thereunto. And then let any Logician in the world judge what reaſon you had to glory in your conqueſt. You ſtand much upon my rending and tearing aſunder the words, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> from the words <hi>Repent and</hi>——. Now this is not ſo, for in a Covenant ſence the Children do repent or make profeſſion of repentance in the Parents that do undertake for them. But if this could be proved, what is it to the force of my Argument which you undertake to anſwer? The <hi>medium,</hi> the middle terme, or the reaſon from the words of the text, is not from the words, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> as you would make the reader beleeve; but from theſe words, <hi>for the Promiſe is to you and your Children.</hi> Becauſe the Children are plainly expreſſed in the word of promiſe; this is to me a true ground wherefore they are contained in the word of Command. Now let any man judge that reads <hi>Baby-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme routed, or the taking of the chief Fort,</hi> as it is in the title of your Pamphlet, what you have done in the body of your anſwer againſt the principall <hi>medium;</hi> againſt the right that the Children have to Baptiſme by the word of Promiſe. Seeing you did grant the Propoſition, it was needfull to ſpend your force upon the aſſumption. Again, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> you inſiſt upon this, that the Jews, the whole Nation of them, becauſe they had a right to the word of Promiſe, why had they not a right to Baptiſme by the word of Command? Here you make a faire flouriſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the generality of the promiſe without any diſtinction at all. But whoſoever he is that will diſtinguiſh the ſeverall diſpenſations of one and the ſame promiſe, and the right that Beleevers and their Children have to the Seal in each diſpenſation, he ſhall find that you have ſaid juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And you that talked ſo much of taking the chief Fort, have ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away ſecretly from it, as the enemy did from the ſeige of <hi>Bergen-ap-Zome,</hi> in the ſmoake of Gun-powder.</p>
               <p>Further, ſuppoſe there had been ſome weakneſſe in my Argument, yet there is no ſuch cauſe (as you adviſe) to remove its Tent from the coaſts of the Text; for I will aſſure you as long as I read theſe words, <hi>For the Promiſe is to you and your Children,</hi> as long as I read theſe words in the laſt exhibition of the Promiſe, and a promiſe anſwering the word
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117779:36"/>of Command; as long as I read a convertibility between the word of Command, and the word of Promiſe, in Baptiſme aſwell as in other Sacraments, I ſhall be loath to obey the order which you ſay you have received from <hi>Quarter-Maſter Generll</hi> to diſcharge me of the Text. But ſeeing you will needs be ſo pitifull to a poor Argumeet (in your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) beaten upon the Ice, I would intreat you that you would not deal ſo unkindly with him, as to remove him from the Text. For if I be not greatly miſtaken, this Scripture is not ſo barren to afford one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Argument, but it is a wel-ſpring and Fountaine of Arguments for the Baptiſme of Beleevers and their Children. When you come to tryall, you will ſind always when you take away one, another will ſpring up.</p>
               <p>But Sir, let the worſt fall out that can be, if you ſhould imagine that there were no footing for my Argument in the Text, and the Text (as you ſay) (<hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>lin.</hi> 10.) would claime no acquaintance or kindred with it; yet the Argument may be true in the general, and may be made good from other Texts of Scripture. For if the Promiſe to Beleevers and their Children doth hold in the times of the laſt exhibition, aſwell as in the two former, then neceſſarily the word of Promiſe will draw in the word of Command, and the right to the Promiſe in its laſt and beſt exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition will inforce a right to the Seal. And ſo we ſhall have a Precept for the Baptiſme of Beleevers and their Children proved from the ſcope of Scripture, and do you your worſt.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, in the laſt place, let me come to the ſtructure and frame of my Argument. You ſay (<hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>lin.</hi> 28.) that the premiſes do not hold due proportion with the concluſion; you ſay, either the premiſes are ſuperfluous, or the concluſion is wanting. I do willingly yeild in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very lawfull Syllogiſme, that the premiſes muſt have due correſpondence with the concluſion. But how? The correſpondence muſt not alwayes be in letters and ſyllables, but in ſenſe and meaning. But why is there ſuch a diſproportion betwixt the premiſes and the concluſion? You ſay, <hi>that the Premiſes ſpeak that the children of Beleevers must have a right; the Concluſion is, they have a right.</hi> You ſay that <hi>muſt have a right,</hi> and <hi>have a right,</hi> are not all one: after a while <hi>is not yet. There be many that are heires in</hi> England, <hi>can ſay they must have,</hi> with caution, <hi>but they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſay they <hi>have in poſſeſſion.</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 13. <hi>lin.</hi> 3.) Sir, theſe are but cavils at words, as any man may plainly ſee: <hi>For have a right,</hi> and <hi>muſt have a right</hi> are all one in the ſenſe of the Argument. Now that I did put in the word <hi>(muſt)</hi> it was to ſhow the union and neceſſary connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:117779:36"/>the two parts of the conditional propoſition. For your inſtance of an heire in <hi>England,</hi> we are not now upon the diviſion of Lands, but upon the union of the parts of a propoſition. But to ſhow that this is a true hypothetical Syllogiſme, I will according to the rule of the Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, reduce it to a Categorical forme, and put it in the firſt figure, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that have a right to be baptized by the word of Promiſe, have a right to be baptized by the word of Command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the word of Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the word of Command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo conſequently there is a word of Command to baptize Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Children in the New Teſtament. Now by the rule of reduction I leave it to your ſelf, and to any other man to judge, what cauſe you had to except againſt the ſtucture of my Syllogiſme.</p>
               <p>You go on, and cavill againſt the Major propoſition, and reaſon thus (<hi>pag.</hi> 13.) If the Children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the word of Promiſe, there is no need of a right to be baptized by the word of Command. Sir, I confeſſe that God is not bound alwayes to adde a Seal to the confirmation of his Promiſe, we may beleeve his word without addition of Seals. But I ſpeak in a Sacramental relation; where he hath once appointed a Sacrament for the uſe of his Church, they that have a right to the Promiſe, have a right to the Seal.</p>
               <p>As for example, The body of the faithfull have a right to remiſſion of ſin by the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> aſwell as their guides and teachers: And therefore under that title, they have (let the Papiſts ſay what they will) a right alſo to the cup of the New Teſtament in <hi>Chriſts</hi> blood, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. So in the like caſe, ſeeing the Promiſe is to Beleevers and their Children in the laſt and beſt exhibition therefore, do what you can, if the Children of Beleevers have a right to the Promiſe ſo exhibited, they muſt have a right to the Seal.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>You call the right that Beleevers children have to baptiſme by the word of Promiſe, a cloudy, ſaying,</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 13.) The ſaying is a clear Scripture truth, but it may be a cloudy ſaying to ſuch as will not ſee what they may ſee. It is a cloudy ſaying at this day to the Jew, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſpoken of in the Prophets; and it is a cloudy ſaying to the Papiſt, that a man is juſtified by Faith alone: and ſo it is a cloudy ſaying to you, that the Children of Beleevers have a right to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:117779:37"/>Baptiſme by the word of Promiſe, as revealedin the laſt times. But you are to conſider that the darkneſſe is not in the ſayings, but the clouds are in your own blind mindes, that cannot or will not ſee the truth.</p>
               <p>You go on, and further except againſt the right that the children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers have to Baptiſme by the word of Promiſe: And becauſe you will put ſome abſurdity upon the ſaying, you argue thus (pag. 13.) <hi>If there be ſuch a neceſſity to baptize the children of Beleeveers, it is either for God to baptize them, or for his ſervants to baptize them.</hi> To ſpeak briefly and plainly, there is a neceſſity of Precept that lieth upon all Chriſtian Parents, that do beleeve the <hi>Chriſt</hi> come in the fleſh to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Faith, and to baptize their Children; For herein lieth a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the Chriſtian profeſſion, not only for the Father to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf by Baptiſme to Chriſt come in the fleſh, but he is bound alſo to bring in his children, and thoſe that live under his education into the ſame ingagement. Therefore, Sir, I do much queſtion, if either you or any man elſe ſhall refuſe to oblige your infants to the Lord Chriſt, whether you do hold forth the whole confeſſion of the faith of Chriſt come in the fleſh. I will make no particular application, but ſure I am, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>John</hi> ſaith in the general, <hi>Every ſpirit that confeſſeth not Chriſt come in the fleſh is not of God, and this is the ſpirit of Antichriſt.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3. But now to ſhut up all, as I began, ſo I conclude, that <hi>there is a Precept in the New Teſtament for the Baptiſme of Infants.</hi> My Argument (as it was formerly) is ſtill the ſame with ſome amplification, I argue from <hi>Peters</hi> words after this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that have a right to Baptiſme by the word of Promiſe, as exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the laſt times, they have a right to be baptized by the word of Command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the children of Beleevers have a right to Baptiſme by the word of Promiſe, as exhibited in the laſt times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the children of Beleevers have a right to be baptized by the word of Command.</hi> And fo conſequently in the New Teſtament there is a Precept to baptize Beleevers and their Children.</p>
               <p>I hope now, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> your chariot wheels will not ſtick, but you and the many thouſands in this land which you ſpeak of, will now drive on to Infant. Baptiſme. You have ſeen. or at leaſt you may ſee by all that which I have ſpoken, that the Promiſe doth hold to beleevers and their Children in the laſt diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>This is the ſcope of <hi>Peters</hi> words. Now then, if the Promiſe doth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:117779:37"/>hold to the Children in the laſt diſpenſation, this will draw in the word of Command to baptize Father and Child: And, for want of better friends, you your ſelf have told us, <hi>for the convertibility of Gods word of Promiſe, and his word of Command, you will not only grant it, but alſo maintaine it.</hi> And this is my anſwer to all yours that came to me in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript.</p>
               <p>Now a word or two concerning your Poſtſcript that came to me only in Print, and here you thus admoniſh mee; <hi>Iſ you have any thoughts left that incline you to ſprinkle Infants, declare it as ſoon as you will, and I ſhall bee ready to take a veiw of it, and give it entertainment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, The queſtion between you and me is not concerning ſprinkling or dipping, this is but an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as Logicians call it, or a leading away from the point. My purpoſe is to follow our buſineſſe in hand to prove a Precept for the Baptiſme of Infants. When this is done, there will be no great matter of difficulty concerning the manner of the thing. I do yeeld that dipping is Baptiſine, but whether are they only baptized that are dipped?</p>
               <p>Further, you adviſe me, <hi>that I pollute not the Scripture with Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, but confeſſe with the reſt of my Brethren of the Clergie that diſputed in</hi> Hardwick Steple-houſe, <hi>that there is no command or example from Scripture for it.</hi> For the reſt of my Brethren, though I know not ſome of the men, and for others that I do know, though I am not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the paſſages between you and them; yet if I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conjecture, you have not dealt with them by your dealing with me. Their words perhaps being taken in a right ſenſe, and it may be in their own meaning; they do not ſtand contradictory to mine. I do agree with them, that there is a Precept impſicite, and examples impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite for the Baptiſme of Intants. I do agree with thoſe, that ſay Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may profeſſe in their Parents: and with others alſo that hold the Baptiſme of Infants by tradition; for Lam verily perſwaded with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> that there hath been a continued ſeries of the Baptiſme of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants from the utmoſt antiquitie, from the Apoſties age to this very day. I do agree with Mr. <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> that the firſt Baptiſme is of great moment; and that a man cannot well make a compact with the Devil, but he muſt renounce the Chriſt to which he hath obliged himſelf in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſme,</p>
               <p>Thus Sir, I have gone through your whole anſwer, I have, to the beſt of my underſtanding, left out nothing of moment. I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117779:38"/>intreat you in your next to do with me as I have done with you, that is, to go thorough the whole body of the Treatiſe; not to catch at letters and ſyllables, but to anſwer point by point in that which concerns the maine. Before I go off, I cannot but put you in mind of your ſcoffing way of writing, in ſo grave and ſerious a matter. What miſeries are now in the Land? What troubles are now in the Conſciences of the godly? And what fears are every where by reaſon of the breaches of the Church, and yet you muſt have your mocks and jeſts at me? If it were proper in thoſe times of the troubles of the State to ſet up a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Britannicus</hi> againſt a <hi>Mercurius Aulicus;</hi> I know no reaſon why in theſe times of the diviſion of the Church, it would not be every way as proper to ſet up a <hi>Mercurius Baptiſts</hi> againſt a <hi>Mercurius Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts.</hi> But in this, Sir, you are like to take your reſt for me. Untill ſome <hi>Mercurius Baptiſts</hi> doth ariſe, you may injoy your <hi>veine.</hi> It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that I have declared my conſcience, that there is a Precept for the Baptiſme of Infants in the New Teſtament. And it is my comfort alſo that I have delivered it in a manner ſome way convenient to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſuch a cauſe. For the reſt I leave you to Maſter <hi>Swayne.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving met with a printed paper intituled <hi>Baby-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme routed,</hi> at the cloſe of which is annexed a <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> in which the Author Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> doth adviſe Mr. <hi>Stephens, not to pollute the Scripture with Infant-Baptiſme, but rather, with his Brethren, who diſputed in</hi> Hardwick Steeple-houſe, <hi>confeſſe there is no example or precept for it in Scripture.</hi> For Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> his polluting of the Scriptures with Infant-Baptiſme, that lieth to be proved. But ſure I am, Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> and his partie did pollute the Sabbath (and in polluting the Sabbath, did pollute the Scriptures) in putting his book againſt Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> to ſale in the Congregation at <hi>Withibrook</hi> on the Lords day: contrary to a late Act of Parliament. By, and through which they did diſhonour God, affront the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, forfeit their goods, and grieve the <hi>poor Heathens</hi> (for ſo they call us) to ſee them ſo to profane the Lords day. For the Brethren of the Clergie in <hi>Hardwick Steeple-houſe</hi> (as he pleaſeth to call them) that they ſhould ſay that there was neither Precept or Example for the Baptiſme of Infants in the New Teſtament: In this he doth them manifeſt in jurie. For I (as being one that there was preſent) do affirme the Contrary. And to uſe Mr. <hi>Everards</hi> own words to Mr. <hi>Stephens, he like a theeviſh Gleaner draggeth out the Miniſters words by the ears from their fellowes.</hi> For this was the expreſſion, <hi>we confeſſe that we have no expreſſe command
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:117779:39"/>or example, but we have both implicitely, and ſound argument for it.</hi> Theſe words were ſpoken by Mr. <hi>Potter,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Radford,</hi> one of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that did conferre with Mr. <hi>Everard.</hi> The truth of this the Notaries, the whole Congregations, and I think his own conſcience can witneſſe. He goeth on, in theſe words; <hi>Or as</hi> Mr. John Moore, <hi>Miniſter of</hi> Weſt-leak <hi>and</hi> Eaſt-leak, <hi>being demanded by what authority he did it? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, by Tradition; reſuſing to give any Scripture for it. And</hi> Mr. Angel <hi>of</hi> Leiceſter <hi>denying Tradition, ſaith that Witches after their conviction, ſay the Devill perſwaded them to deny their firſt Baptiſme:</hi> Ergo, <hi>it was good, otherwiſe he would not perſwade them from it.</hi> Mr. Wilſon, <hi>Miniſter of</hi> Seagrave <hi>differs from them all, affirming that Repentance is required before Baptiſme, and being demanded how Infants could be capable of Baptiſme; he affirmed, they ought to repent before they were borne.</hi> The like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have Mr. <hi>Swan</hi> and Mr. <hi>Boſſe.</hi> So far Mr. <hi>Everard.</hi> Here now if by Mr. <hi>Swan</hi> he intends me, I am ſure, neither he, nor his partie ever heard any ſuch arguments from me for the baptizing of Infants: and I am ſure (if he were put to it) he cannot prove what he affirmes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (Reader) take notice that Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> will not ſtick to Print falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods for his advantage and glory, and the plucking down and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the partie which he doth oppoſe. That I do him no wrong, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe paſſages following. He came to <hi>Withibrook</hi> Congregation, with others of his partie of <hi>Eſen-hall,</hi> the ſixth of <hi>October</hi> (the day when they ſold their books aforeſaid) thither they came to require ſatisfaction; for he then ſaid I had aſperſed him. At which time I offered him ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>if he came to deal with me as a Brother.</hi> I urged his breach of our Saviours rule, <hi>If thy Brother ſinne againſt thee,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 18.15. He ſaid he knew the Text, and further he and others anſwered, <hi>I was no Brother but an Heathen.</hi> They alſo ſaid, <hi>All out of the Order they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in, were Heathens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt which I thus argue, If all out of their order be Heathens, then <hi>ſtrangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, having no hope, without God in the world.</hi> So is an Heathen defined, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. And if without God, and without hope, then without ſalvation, and then indeed no true Church. But doth Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> and his friends think that all out of their order are Heathens? or did they not go againſt their light when they thus ſaid? If their conſcience ſpeak the ſame language, that all are Pagans, they muſt judge them ſo, either becauſe they are ſtrangers from the Covenant of Promiſe, or becauſe they are not baptized after their manner. If Heathens, becauſe ſtrangers from the Covenant of Promiſe;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:117779:39"/>then no hope of ſalvation, then a neceſſity of condemnation to all out of their order. But if Heathens, becauſe not baptized after their manner, then their Baptiſme only will make Chriſtians of Heathens: and none can be ſaved without their Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If they ſay, all are Gentiles out of their order, becauſe the outward court is troden down by all thoſe out of their order. This will help nothing, becauſe it will follow upon their own principies, that there was no outward Court nor Church miniſteriall, nor Ordinances to be troden down all along the times of Antichriſts reigne. For if all out of their order were and are Heathens, then there were none but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to be troden down, and ſo Heathens muſt tread down Heathens; except they will yeeld a Church viſible, and an outward Court. And in ſo doing they loſe their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Again, If Heathens, becauſe not baptized after their manner, and conſequently no Church; thea Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> and thoſe of his judgment, were no Church before they received this new Baptiſme; but they were Pagans aſwell as others. If they were no true Church, their firſt Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator was no true Adminiſtrator, becauſe there was no Church to conferre an office upon him. Therefore they muſt ſay, he had his firſt Commiſſion immediatly from heaven, unleſſe they will affirme that Heathens have a power to make an Adminiſtrator of Baptiſme. Now this is contrary to the Scripture, which ſaith, <hi>they ordained Elders in every Church,</hi> Acts 14.23. Therefore in the ordinary way the Church is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Elders or Adminiſtrators. But if they ſhall ſay there was an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mſtrator before a Church. as <hi>John Baptist:</hi> and therefore by the like reaſon they may have ſuch a one. If they ſay this, they muſt prove from the Prophets that the Goſpel-Churches muſt have two Baptiſts, be twice planted: which ſuppoſeth to Goſpel-Church in the world before the coming of the ſecond Baptiſt to plant a new Church.</p>
            <p>Further, alſo they muſt ſay, that there is a ſecond Chriſt before whom the ſecond Baptiſt muſt come as a forerunner; And ſo new inſtitutions, and foundations of Ordinances, Baptiſts, Apoſtles, Miracles; and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not this conceit runne?</p>
            <p>But if they ſay, that the Commiſſion <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. was their firſt Adminiſtrators rule, then he muſt be a Diſciple made by ordinary prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and teaching, before he had authority to Miniſter their new Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, whoſoever he was. And was he taught by ſome Heathen (think they) or by a Diſciple? By an Heathen they cannot ſay. And if by a preaching Diſciple, then Chriſt had a Diſciple before their new
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:117779:40"/>Baptiſme. Therefore they that want their new Baptiſme, cannot bee ſtated Heathens. And how foule then was their aſſertion at <hi>Withibrook,</hi> to call all Heathens out of their order? And yet have neither command nor example in Scripture for their Baptiſme, in reference to their firſt Miniſters Commiſſion or authority.</p>
            <p>And doth not this their practiſe come here to be condemned, which continueth judging our Churches, and all out of their order, to be Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, for want of their Baptiſme? Therefore let all tender-hearted Chriſtians take heed how they are intangled in ſuch a ſociety and practiſe, as will be a continuall condemning and judging of all out of their order, though never ſo godly. But if Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> and his friends are ſtill of the ſame mind, let them with tenderneſſe conſider two things: Firſt, upon what a poor foundation their Baptiſme ſtands, which muſt neceſſarily be upon an Heatheniſh foundation, or upon extraordinary revelation. The ſecond thing I would intreat them to conſider, is, how they, both in judgment and practiſe, continue condemning the generation of the juſt to hell, at leaſt all living and dead, that are not of their ſociety. What not one Saint by calling in all <hi>England,</hi> neither in Magiſtracy, Miniſtery, nor People, that is not of themſelves? all ſtrangers to God and his Chriſt? Then ſurely there is no hope that any thing will be done for the Kingdom of Chriſt by ſuch a Magiſtracy or Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Therefore let me intreat them not to be offended if I put a queſtion to them; <hi>What would they do with ſuch an Heathen Magiſtracy, Miniſtry, or</hi> (as one calleth them in his late book) <hi>officiating Prieſts, in caſe the power were wholly in their hands?</hi> For the Miniſtry it is clear to all the world. And for the Magiſtracy, I leave it to his judgment. For my part, I fear it.</p>
            <p>I do not intend in theſe lines the Moderate of thoſe that diſſent from me in point of Baptiſme, but Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> and thoſe of his judgment, and the reſt that are ſo bitter againſt the godly of the Miniſtry. From them I ſhall expect an anſwer; in which they may do well to prove that their practiſe is grounded upon a Precept, in reference to their firſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators authority to baptize: And when it comes to my hands, I ſhall conſider it.</p>
